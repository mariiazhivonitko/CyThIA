 | Medium Oct 08, 2024 TLP
Executive Summary:
The United States election process is a fundamental  pillar of its democracy, involving a vast network of federal and state agencies, political
parties, candidates, and, most importantly, the vot ing public. As elections approach, it's imperative to recogniz e and understand the array of
cyber threats that could impact the integrity and t rustworthiness of this critical process.
 
Cyber adversaries, including state-sponsored actors  and hacktivist groups, are increasingly active in the lead-up to elections. For US-specific
threats, the dark web has become a hub for maliciou s actors to trade sensitive information and develop  strategies to exploit vulnerabilities.
Hacktivist groups are also mobiliz ing, aiming to di srupt proceedings or sway public opinion through co ordinated cyber campaigns.
 
However, one of the biggest threats is state-sponso red entities that employ sophisticated tactics to i nfiltrate systems, steal data, and
disseminate misinformation. Their activities can un dermine confidence in the electoral process and pot entially alter outcomes. Malicious
actors are also utiliz ing artificial intelligence t o create and automate the spread of disinformation and misinformation, thereby shaping public
opinion in unintended ways. Commonly exploited vuln erabilities, such as outdated software and inadequa te security protocols, make systems
more susceptible to attacks.
 
Election infrastructure, government agencies engage d in electoral processes, political campaigns, medi a organiz ations, and technology
providers could all be at risk during this time. Th ese and similar entities must prioritiz e cybersecur ity measures to protect against potential
breaches and ensure the integrity of the electoral process. This report provides a comprehensive overv iew of the potential cyber threat
landscape and critical vulnerabilities that could i mpact the election process. This analysis is crucia l for preparing and safeguarding against
cyberattacks that could disrupt or influence electi on outcomes.
 
In this report, FortiGuard Labs Threat Research pro vides an in-depth analysis of threats gathered from  January 2024 to August 2024 that may
affect US-based entities and the electoral process.  It also examines the diverse array of challenges p osed by cyber threats, assesses their
impact on the present US elections, and provides gu idance on how to protect critical environments and systems.

Key Observations
 
It is important to note that while not all these da ta points may seem directly connected to the US ele ction, they indicate a spike in threat activity tha t
coincides with that event. In addition, they all in clude either access to the private data of US citiz ens, which could be used for voter fraud or the
distribution of misinformation, access to compromis ed government and business entities that could be t argeted for things like fraud or the disruption
of critical infrastructures, or a rise in malicious  activities which could be used to exploit users, s uch as those interested in the election, or to disr upt
information systems or critical infrastructure.
 
Scams Targeting US Elections:
Since January 2024, we have identified the registra tion of over 1,000 new domain names. These domains follow particular patterns,
frequently incorporating election-related terms and  references to prominent political figures.
The majority of these domains are registered in the  United States (636 domains), followed by Canada (7 2 domains) and Germany (22
domains).
The most used hosting providers for these election- themed websites are AMAZON-02, which currently host s 458 domains,
CLOUDFLARENET, with 71 domains, and NAMECHEAP-NET, which hosts 70 domains.
One threat actor (TA) sells two distinct phishing k its, priced at $1,260 each, designed to impersonate  political leaders Donald Trump and
Kamala Harris.
 
Darknet Landscape:
Over 1.3 billion rows of combo lists, which include  usernames, email addresses, and passwords, signify  a considerable risk for credential-
stuffing attacks. In such attacks, cybercriminals u se these stolen credentials to gain unauthoriz ed ac cess to accounts, making it a valid
and substantial security concern.
The discovery of 300,000 rows of credit card data, which include CVV, name, card number, expiry date, and date of birth, highlights
potential financial fraud risks targeting voters an d election officials.
Over 2 billion rows of user databases on the Darkne t indicate a heightened exposure to identity theft and targeted phishing attacks.
10% of the posts on Darknet forums are associated w ith Social Security Number (SSN) databases, which p oses a significant threat by
increasing the risk of personal data breaches.
Around 3% of the posts on Darknet forums involve da tabases related to business and government entities . These databases hold critical
organiz ational data that is vulnerable to cyber exp loits.
The majority of network access advertisements on th e Darknet focus on corporate VPNs (35%), followed c losely by Remote Desktop
Protocol (RDP) access (32%) and Remote Desktop Web (RDWeb) access (25%).
Espionage Landscape:
A total of 23 state-sponsored adversaries have been  documented targeting the US, with actors from Chin a leading in activity, followed
by Russia and Iran.
We anticipate increased cyber espionage activities from China, Russia, Iran, and North Korean threat a ctors aimed at disrupting or
manipulating the US electoral process and political  landscape.
AI-enhanced and AI-generated audio content are beco ming increasingly potent tools in disinformation ca mpaigns. Our research has
revealed that threat actors on the Darknet are adve rtising deepfake services starting at just USD 15, making this technology highly
accessible for malicious purposes. A recent instanc e demonstrated the danger of this technology when a  deepfake of President Joe
Biden’s voice was used in a robocall during the New  Hampshire primary , highlighting how easily such technology can be we aponiz ed.
 
Hacktivist Landscape:
NoName057(16), CyberArmyofRussia_Reborn, and Killne t are pro-Russian hacktivist groups with recently i ncreased activity that could play
a significant role in disrupting elections. Their c apabilities and historical activities suggest they have the means to impact processes if
they choose to engage in such actions.
GARNESIA_TEAM, FromLammerToMastah, and Z-BL4CX-H4T are two prominent groups that have conducted the mo st operations since
January 2024.
Ransomware Landscape:
Over 1000 ransomware victims have been reported fro m January 2024 to the time of publication of this r eport.
'Lockbit3,   'Play,' and 'RansomHub' are the top thr ee ransomware groups focused on targeting the US. T heir primary target is the
Manufacturing sector, followed by the Business Serv ices and Construction industries.
We have observed a notable spike in ransomware atta cks against the US Government (+28%), Hospitality ( +18%), Real Estate (+5%), and
Transportation (+5%) compared to 2023.
Vulnerability Landscape:In 2024, there were 291 known exploited CVEs, with 128 added to CISA's KEV and 55 specifically used in  targeted threat campaigns against
US infrastructure.
Of the vulnerabilities that have been exploited, es pionage actors have exploited 46%, cybercrime actor s are responsible for exploiting 39%,
and ransomware groups account for 15%.
 
Scams Targeting US Elections
Since January 2024, FortiGuard Labs Threat Research  has identified the registration of over 1000+ new domain names . These domains follow
particular patterns, frequently incorporating elect ion-related terms and references to prominent polit ical figures. Examples of these patterns
include " votefor ," "vote4 ," "trump2024 ," "voteharris ," "2024harris-kelly ", "trumpvancetransition ," "uselection ," etc.
 
The prevalence of these terms suggests that threat actors are interested in leveraging the heightened interest surrounding the 2024 US
elections to potentially conduct malicious activiti es such as phishing campaigns, disinformation, or l aunching cyberattacks to influence voter
behavior and undermine electoral integrity.
(Newly registered domain names incorporating electi on-related terms)
 
Analysis of  Potentially Malicious Domain Registrati ons
Domains by IP Address : A notable concentration of domains is associated with a limited number of IP addresses. Specifically , the IP
addresses 15.197.148.33 and 3.33.130.190 each host 126 domains, making them the most active in our dat aset. These domains hosted on
the IPs indicate a centraliz ed approach by threat a ctors to efficiently manage multiple malicious doma ins to execute large-scale cyber
campaigns.
Dominance of  Registrant Countries : The majority of these domains are registered in t he United States (636 domains), followed by
Canada (72 domains) and Germany (22 domains). The h igh number of US-based registrations indicates eith er the presence of domestic
threat actors or the utiliz ation of US hosting serv ices to hide the origin of malicious activities.
Pref erred Hosting Providers : Analysis of hosting providers reveals a strong pr eference for well-known and widely used services.
AMAZON-02 leads with 458 domains, followed by CLOUD FLARENET (71 domains) and NAMECHEAP-NET (70 domains ). The reliance on major
hosting platforms such as Amaz on Web Services (AWS)  and Cloudflare suggests that threat actors are lev eraging these reputable
services to enhance the legitimacy and resilience o f their malicious domains.
 
Donation Scam
With the US election approaching, the surge in poli tical engagement and donations provides a fertile g round for cybercriminals. As seen in past
elections, particularly the 2020 race, where contri butions reached unprecedented levels, the influx of  funds makes campaigns attractive
targets for malicious actors. The increase in finan cial activity around elections creates numerous opp ortunities for exploitation, especially by
those seeking to take advantage of heightened publi c interest and large-scale political donations.
 
FortiGuard Labs Threat Research has identified a nu mber of fraudulent fundraising websites, including secure[.]actsblues[.]com , which is
designed to imitate the legitimate ActBlue site ( secure[.]actblue[.]com ). ActBlue is a nonprofit American fundraising plat form and political
action committee founded in 2004. This deceptive we bsite is set up to collect donations and personal d etails such as credit card information,
names, emails, and full residential addresses.

Additionally, cybercriminals across Darknet forums are viewing the upcoming election as a prime opport unity for quick profits. In one recent
post, we observed an interesting project featuring phishing pages designed to impersonate political le aders Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.
The TA is offering two separate phishing kits for $ 1,260 each—one targeting Donald Trump supporters an d the other targeting Kamala Harris
supporters. These kits are designed to harvest pers onal information, including names, addresses, and c redit card (donation) details.
 
The consequences of these phishing threats are sign ificant, as they can lead to the widespread theft o f personal information, including
names, addresses, and credit card details. This put s individuals at risk of financial fraud and underm ines trust in the political process. By
targeting supporters of political figures like Dona ld Trump and Kamala Harris, cybercriminals could cr eate division, spread misinformation, and
manipulate voters' opinions. Additionally, such att acks can lead to identity theft and facilitate furt her exploitation through the resale of stolen
data on dark web marketplaces. Below is the attache d screenshot of the forum post.
 
(Darknet forum post advertisement of phishing proje ct)
 
 Darknet Landscape
The Darknet serves as a central platform for many o f the cyber threats that pose significant risks to the integrity of the US elections. Malicious
actors use this platform to exchange sophisticated tools, exploit methods, and unauthoriz ed network ac cess credentials that could result in
political influence and disruption. Dark web forums  can also facilitate the sale of sensitive electora l information, discussions on vulnerabilities
within election systems, and the coordination of cy berattacks to undermine the electoral process.
 
Threats to US elections from these Darknet activiti es include data breaches of voter databases, theft of intellectual property related to
election technology, and the sale of insider inform ation that could be used to manipulate election out comes. Such activities can lead to
operational disruptions and erosion of public trust , along with significant financial repercussions.
 
The following section will delve deeper into the se curity landscape surrounding election databases and  the types of access being advertised
and shared by threat actors, highlighting the subst antial risks these activities pose to the US electo ral system.
Database Advertisements
Our analysis reveals a significant number of divers e databases available on Darknet forums targeting t he United States, posing serious threats
to the integrity of US elections.
 
Approximately 40% of the posts on Darknet involve c ombo lists (usernames/email addresses and passwords ). These combo lists can be
used for large-scale credential stuffing and unauth oriz ed access, potentially compromising voter data,  election systems, and sensitive
information. More than 1.3 billion rows of combo li sts are currently being advertised across different  Darknet forums.
Credit card and banking data, constituting about 21 % of the posts with 300k rows, pose significant ris ks of financial fraud and phishing,
targeting users in the US. These actions could lead  to campaign disruptions, undermining voter outreac h, destabiliz ing financial support
for candidates, or enabling fraudulent campaign fun ding.
User databases, such as those for doctors, musician s, and investors, make up roughly 19% of the posts,  with over 2 billion rows. These
databases can facilitate identity theft and targete d phishing, risking the security of those involved in elections and eroding public trust.
Social Security Number (SSN) databases, about 10% o f the posts, increase the risk of data breaches and  cyberattacks, with one instance
advertising an SSN database with over 19 gigabytes (about 80 million rows) of data.
Business and government databases each account for about 3% of posts, holding records on user informat ion and government details.
Notably, a threat actor from the group CyberNiggers  claimed a breach of the US Department of Transport ation's database, leaking over
5.8 million entries.
Lastly, although less common at 2% and 1%, KYC data bases and business combo lists still pose substanti al risks for sophisticated
cyberattacks. One reported case involved a KYC data base containing over ten terabytes of data.

Network Access Advertisements
Network access refers to the various levels or meth ods of unauthoriz ed access to digital assets and sy stems advertised or offered for sale on
Darknet forums. These include access credentials, r emote access tools, exploits, backdoors, or comprom ised accounts, among others. These
advertisements typically target TAs seeking unautho riz ed access to systems or data for malicious purpo ses. The pricing of access advertised
on the Darknet forums can fluctuate significantly, depending on the type of organiz ation and the count ry. Based on our observation, these
types of accesses are often obtained through privat e stealer logs.
 
The table below presents the most commonly advertis ed network access types on Darknet forums targeting  the United States.
 (Network access advertisement types) 
Below are the various types of network access predo minantly shared and advertised by the following thr eat actors (TAs).
Corporate VPNs :

Espionage Landscape
Nation-state actors or APT groups have the resource s to engage in cyber espionage, such as gathering i ntelligence on the US electoral process,
political landscape, and strategic interests. Espio nage can involve reconnaissance, phishing, and malw are attacks targeting government
agencies, political organiz ations, and critical inf rastructure or the distribution of disinformation.
 
This section examines the data we have compiled on espionage activities targeting the US by foreign ad versaries this past year and highlights
those APT groups that have targeted the US in previ ous campaigns.

Exploring AI and Disinformation Campaigns in Shapin g Public Opinion
Threat actors often launch coordinated disinformati on campaigns to spread false narratives, propaganda , and misleading information to
manipulate public opinion and influence voter behav ior. These campaigns can target social media platfo rms, messaging apps, and online
forums to spread false information and propaganda.
 
AI-enhanced and AI-generated audio content are beco ming powerful tools in disinformation campaigns, po tentially significantly impacting US
elections. Deepfake technology, which can create co nvincing audio and video imitations, allows threat actors to fabricate statements,
speeches, or interviews of political candidates, sp reading false information that can manipulate publi c opinion. Our research has revealed
advertisements on Darknet platforms offering Deepfa ke services starting at just USD 15. These AI-gener ated disinformation and fake audio
clips designed to mimic the voices of political fig ures could be circulated widely on social media, ge nerating controversy or altering voter
behavior.
 
(Deepfake services advertised on darknet)
AI technology has demonstrated its potential to inf luence public opinion and manipulate voter behavior  in elections. Instances such as the
mimicking of President Joe Biden's voice in a roboc all during the New Hampshire primary, the circulati on of an AI-generated voice discussing
false plans by a candidate in Slovakia, the manipul ation of audio clips to falsely implicate candidate s in Nigeria, and the spread of deepfake
videos in Bangladesh all highlight the impact of AI  in shaping electoral outcomes.
 
To emphasiz e this point, the US Office of the Director of National Intellige nce (ODNI) released a document indicating that Russia, China and Iran
are increasing their election influence operations using generative AI tools to speed development and reach.
 
Below are some recent disinformation campaigns by v arious threat actors that have targeted the US.

This year, on Taiwan’s election day, a sophisticate d threat group 'Storm-1376' posted suspected AI-gen erated audio clips of Foxconn owner
Terry Gou, an Independent Party candidate in Taiwan ’s presidential race, who bowed out of the contest in November 2023. The audio
recordings portrayed Gou's voice endorsing another candidate in the presidential race. Gou’s voice in the recordings is likely AI-generated, as
Gou made no such statement. 
It's important to highlight that Storm-1376 has a t rack record of conducting disinformation campaigns across different regions and events.
According to Microsof t , in August 2023, as wildfires raged on the northwe st coast of Maui, Hawaii, Storm-1376 seiz ed the cha nce to spread
conspiratorial narratives on multiple social media platforms. These posts alleged the US government ha d deliberately set the fires to test a
military-grade weather weapon. In addition to posti ng the text in at least 31 languages across doz ens of websites and platforms, Storm-1376
used AI-generated images of burning coastal roads a nd residences to make the content more eye-catching .
 
Based on observed behavior, it's highly likely that  state-sponsored threat actors from China, Russia, and Iran could use similar tactics to target
the US government and critical infrastructure and c ause disruption during the election process. This p oses a serious threat to election security
and public trust.
 
Hacktivist Landscape
There has been a notable increase in cyber hacktivi sm activities this past year, particularly by pro-R ussian groups aimed at disrupting high-
profile events, such as US elections. These groups have demonstrated significant capabilities in deplo ying distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
attacks against critical infrastructure. In May 202 4, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Ag ency (CISA), in collaboration with Canadian
and U.K. cybersecurity bodies, issued a joint alert  about a surge in pro-Russian hacktivist activities . These groups targeted small-scale OT
systems in critical sectors such as water, energy, and agriculture.
 
CyberArmyof Russia_Reborn  (CARR) , a pro-Russian hacktivist group linked to state ac tors, has been particularly active in targeting US and
European infrastructure. In January 2024, CARR clai med responsibility for manipulating water tanks in Texas, showcasing the group’s ability to
exploit known vulnerabilities in industrial control  systems (ICS). CARR’s activities extend to low-imp act but persistent DDoS attacks and ICS
manipulations across various sectors.
 
Based on our observations and their group's previou s campaigns, we have compiled a list of hacktivist groups based on their activities that
could likely play a pivotal role in disrupting the US elections. The chart represents the most active groups and their activities. 
(Active hacktivist groups along with their overall activities)

Ransomware Landscape
Ransomware attacks raise concerns about the integri ty and security of sensitive data, including voter information and election results. There's
also the risk of political manipulation if attacker s choose to selectively target certain government e ntities or election-related systems. 
 
Ransomware attacks targeting government agencies be fore an election can seriously affect the electoral  process and public trust in
government institutions. Before an election, such a ttacks could disrupt critical government functions related to the electoral process, such as
voter registration databases, election management s ystems, or communication channels used by election officials. This could lead to delays
in voter registration, voting process disruptions, and results. 
 
(Top 5 ransomware groups targeting the US in 2024)
 
Over the past eight months, our data indicates that  the US manufacturing sector has been the primary t arget of cyberattacks, followed
closely by business services and construction. Rans omware groups frequently target multiple sectors to  cause widespread disruption and
chaos.
 
While examining the shifts in sectoral activity bet ween 2023 and 2024, it’s essential to point out tha t we’ve adjusted the 2023 figures to cover
just the first eight months. This adjustment ensure s we’re comparing the same timeframe—the first eigh t months of each year—making our
year-over-year analysis as precise as possible.

Vulnerability Landscape
While not all of these vulnerabilities are being us ed against voters or to target the election, this s ection does highlight the extensive range of
exploitable vulnerabilities available to those wish ing to do so. Commonly exploited vulnerabilities re present a crucial aspect of the cybersecurity
landscape. These vulnerabilities, often stemming fr om weaknesses in software, networks, or systems, se rve as prime targets for threat actors
seeking to exploit them for malicious purposes. Thr eat actors leverage a variety of techniques to expl oit these vulnerabilities, ranging from
known exploits to newly developed ones, to breach s ystems and gain unauthoriz ed access.
TAs also continuously monitor security advisories a nd patches released by software vendors to identify  vulnerabilities that users may have not
yet patched. Once identified, they quickly capitali z e on these vulnerabilities before patches are wide ly implemented, maximiz ing their window
of opportunity to launch attacks. However, it's als o common for threat actors to exploit old vulnerabi lities using tried and tested methods. In
2024, 291 unique known vulnerabilities  are reported to be being actively exploited.

Conclusion
The upcoming 2024 US elections face a range of cybe r threats, many of which could have serious implica tions for electoral integrity. Based on
the current landscape and the recent growth of rela ted dark web activity, state-sponsored actors, hack tivist groups, and cybercriminals may
likely target election infrastructure and associate d systems. The rise of dark web activities, includi ng the sale of sensitive electoral data,
combo lists, and network access credentials, sugges ts that malicious actors can leverage these resourc es to disrupt election processes.
Threats may manifest in various forms, such as cred ential-stuffing attacks, ransomware, or disinformat ion campaigns powered by deepfake
and AI-generated content to sway public opinion and  undermine voter confidence. With state-sponsored a ctors from China, Russia, and Iran
likely to play a significant role in these efforts,  it is essential to anticipate and mitigate these r isks through proactive cybersecurity strategies.
Without adequate defense measures in place, the ele ction process could be vulnerable to manipulation, misinformation, and operational
disruptions, potentially altering the electoral out come and shaking the public's trust in democratic i nstitutions.
FortiGuard Labs Threat Research anticipates the fol lowing sectors are at higher risk and prone to cybe rattacks during the US election:
Political Parties and Candidates : Adversaries may target political parties and cand idates with cyberattacks aimed at stealing
sensitive information, disrupting campaign activiti es, or spreading disinformation to undermine their credibility. 
Media Outlets : Adversaries could target media outlets to manipul ate public opinion by spreading false narratives, f abricating
endorsements, or disseminating misleading informati on to sway voter perceptions. 
Government Institutions : Adversaries may target government institutions in volved in organiz ing and overseeing elections, such  as
election commissions and administrative bodies, to disrupt electoral processes, compromise voter regis tration data, or manipulate
election results. 
Critical Inf rastructure : Adversaries could target critical infrastructure sectors, such as power grids, transportation networ ks, or
telecommunications systems, to create chaos and dis rupt the electoral process, potentially leading to voter disenfranchisement or
logistical challenges. 
Telecommunications Sector : Adversaries may target telecommunications compani es to disrupt communication networks, intercept
sensitive communications, or launch cyberattacks to  disrupt voter outreach efforts or manipulate publi c discourse. 
Technology Organizations : Adversaries may target technology organiz ations, including software companies, IT service providers,  and
cloud service providers, to steal intellectual prop erty, exploit vulnerabilities, or compromise digita l infrastructure to steal data or show their
technological prowess. 
Civil Society : Adversaries may target individuals, such as voter s, campaign volunteers, or influential public figur es, through phishing
attacks, social engineering tactics, or surveillanc e activities to gather intelligence, manipulate opi nions, or compromise their personal
information.
The potential cyberattacks on these various sectors  highlight the multifaceted nature of election secu rity challenges and underscore the
need for comprehensive cybersecurity measures to sa feguard the integrity of the US election.
 
Recommendations
FortiGuard Labs Threat Research recommends the foll owing best security practices to safeguard against cyber-attacks:
Employee Training and Awareness : Conduct regular training sessions for election of ficials, political campaign staff, and volunteers t o
educate them about the risks of phishing attacks. R aise awareness about common phishing tactics, such as deceptive emails and fake
websites, and teach employees how to identify and r eport suspicious emails.
Public Awareness Campaigns : Launch public awareness campaigns to educate vote rs about the risks of phishing attacks and how to
protect themselves from online threats. Provide gui dance on recogniz ing phishing emails, avoiding susp icious links and attachments,
and reporting potential phishing attempts to electi on authorities.
Protect Your Sensitive Data : Organiz ations should make use of SOAR (Security O rchestration, Automation, and Response), which can
detect unusual activities by privileged users and, if needed, block such activities. With the advent o f ransomware, having complete and
current backups of all your data can be a lifesaver . Backing up data is one of information security’s best practices that has been gaining
increased relevance in recent years. A strong backu p strategy also means you are resilient to accident s. NOTE: Don't rely solely on online
backups, and don't use the same passwords for your production environment and backups. It is always sa fe to have a backup of your
cloud backup in another offsite backup location. Al l these backups should also be encrypted and should  have access control set.
Monitor External Attack Surf ace : It is vital to discover IT infrastructures your o rganiz ation is exposed to, and that may be vulnerab le to
attack. We have commonly seen attackers selling RDP  access and databases by abusing misconfigurations on web servers. Monitoring
external attack surfaces allows security teams to p rotect their organiz ations from vulnerabilities and  discover unknown assets and
commonly abused services.
Enf orce Multi-Factor Authentication and a Strong Pa ssword Policy : We continuously monitor the Darknet for leaked cr edentials of
organiz ational portals used by employees and regula rly find them compromised and sold on the Darknet. Organiz ations can reduce the
risk of such exposure by enforcing Multi-Factor Aut hentication and a strong password policy.
Endpoint Protection : Even the best-trained staff occasionally makes mi stakes. Antivirus and antimalware software installe d on
computers adds an extra layer of protection, especi ally against phishing attacks and credential steale rs. The best antivirus and
antimalware programs are only as good as their late st patches. Regularly installing patches will preve nt hackers from exploiting the
system's weaknesses.
Patch Operating Systems and Sof tware Regularly : Update software promptly as updates become availa ble. Prioritiz e patching known
exploited vulnerabilities, especially those CVEs th at are reported as critical and high and that allow  for remote code execution or denial-
of-service on internet-facing equipment. Implement vendor-approved workarounds if a patch for a known exploited or critical
vulnerability cannot be quickly applied.
DDoS Protection : Secure your infrastructure with DDoS attack preve ntion solutions. Equip your network, applications, and infrastructure
with multi-level protection strategies. This may in clude prevention management systems that combine fi rewalls, VPNs, anti-spam,
content filtering, and other security layers to mon itor activities and identify traffic inconsistencie s that may be symptoms of DDoS
attacks.
Preventing ransomware attacks : Organiz ations must implement proactive measures, including regularly updating software and
operating systems to patch known vulnerabilities. A dditionally, organiz ations should regularly back up  critical data and ensure that
backups are stored securely offline to prevent them  from being encrypted by ransomware. User education  and awareness training are
also essential to help employees recogniz e and avoi d ransomware threats. By taking a multi-layered app roach to ransomware
prevention, organiz ations can significantly reduce their susceptibility to damaging attacks.
Website Def acement : Organiz ations should ensure the implementation of  Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) that can provide an
additional layer of defense by filtering and blocki ng malicious traffic before it reaches the website.
Stealer Inf ection : Carry out robust threat hunting based on the comp romised account. Check AV/EDR and SIEM logs to iden tify any
malicious activities. Once an infected system is id entified, isolate it and perform reimaging.
Threat Intelligence : Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) helps enterprises  collect data about current and potential cyber ris ks and determine
those cyberattacks that can threaten their security . Darknet Threat Intelligence can also help organiz ations monitor any Darknet chatter
related to the organiz ation or any data leaks that can result in financial losses to the organiz ations  before they are even out in the public.
Such crucial and time-sensitive data can help organ iz ations handle incidents appropriately and take th e necessary legal steps.
