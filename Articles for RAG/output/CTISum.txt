CyberThreatIntelligence(CTI)summarizationinvolvesgeneratingconciseandaccuratehighlights
from web intelligence data, which is critical for providing decision-makers with actionable insights to
swiftly detect and respond to cyber threats in the cybersecurity domain. Despite that, the development
of efficient techniques for summarizing CTI reports, comprising facts, analytical insights, attack
processes, and more, has been hindered by the lack of suitable datasets. To address this gap, we
introduce CTISum, a new benchmark dataset designed for the CTI summarization task. Recognizing
thesignificanceofunderstandingattackprocesses,wealsoproposeanovelfine-grainedsubtask: attack
process summarization, which aims to help defenders assess risks, identify security gaps, and uncover
vulnerabilities. Specifically, a multi-stage annotation pipeline is designed to collect and annotate
CTI data from diverse web sources, alongside a comprehensive benchmarking of CTISum using both
extractive, abstractive and LLMs-based summarization methods. Experimental results reveal that
current state-of-the-art models face significant challenges when applied to CTISum, highlighting that
automaticsummarizationofCTIreportsremainsanopenresearchproblem. Thecodeandexample

1. Introduction
Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), also known as threat
intelligence, is knowledge, skills and experience-based infor-
mation concerning the occurrence and assessment of both
cyber and physical threats as well as threat actors [ 17,12].
The CTI data often originates from diverse web sources, in-
cluding forums, blogs, and open-source repositories, making
itdifficultforanalyststoefficientlylocatethemostrelevant
and high-value intelligence from the web. Therefore, it be-
comes crucial to automatically summarize the knowledge
containedinCTIreports,whichcouldhelpanalystssimply
identify events, patterns, cyber attacks and conclusions. Fur-
thermore, CTI summarization has broad applicability across
domains like cybersecurity [ 36], military intelligence [ 39],
technical alerts, threat modeling, and more, where compli-
cated information needs to be distilled into concise insights.
With the ongoing advancement of summarization tech-
niques, numerous datasets have emerged, such as CNN/-
DailyMail[ 28]andXSum[ 29],amongothers. Inaddition,
the introduction of these datasets further drives the devel-
opmentofassociatedtechnologieslikePGNet[ 37],BART
[19], BRIO [ 23], etc. Furthermore, domain-specific sum-
marization researches have gradually arisen. Examples in-
clude biomedicine [ 46], finance [ 26], law [38], etc. This fur-
ther facilitates various applications involving aiding medical
decision-making,generatingfinancialreports,andsummariz-
inglegaldocuments. Theboomofdomain-specificsumma-

Models(LLMs)[ 14,9,30,40,7,6]haveshownpromising
text understanding and generation capabilities. Therefore,
this raises the question: How might we construct a high-
quality CTI summarization dataset with the assistance of
LLMs?
In this paper, we construct a new benchmark CTISum
basedonthreatintelligenceobtainedfromdiversewebsources
in the cybersecurity domain. In addition to the CTI Summa-
rization (CTIS) task, considering the importance of attack
process,weproposeanovelfine-grainedsubtask,AttackPro-
cess Summarization (APS), to enable defenders to quickly
understandreportedattackbehaviors,assessrisksandidentify
security vulnerabilities. Specifically, a multi-stage annota-
tion pipeline is designed to preprocess web CTI reports and
obtainannotationdatawiththeassistanceofLLMs,which
includes the data collection stage, parsing & cleaning stage,
promptschemastageandintelligencesummarizationstage.
To further keep the high quality of the CTISum, we addi-
tionallyemployexpertreviewsfordoublechecking(details
can be seen in Section 3.1). With proper data, automated
systemscanhelpsynthesizelengthyCTIreportsintoconcise
and accurate summaries for different intelligence analysts. A
sampledreportandreferencesummaryinCTISumareshown
in Figure1. Thesystem notonly requiresto makea general
summary of the full document (task 1), but also needs the
capabilitytofocusonandgeneratetheattackprocess(task2).
After cleaningand human checking,CTISum obtains 1,345
documents and corresponding summaries.
What makes CTISum a challenging dataset can be pre-
sentedasfollows. First,theaveragedocumentlengthisabout
2,865 words. Current deep learning techniques are inca-
pableofprocessingdocumentssurpassing512/1024tokens
in length (after tokenization), such as GPT1[ 33], T5[34],
BART[19] and so on. Although LLMs can deal with longer
input, however, fine-tuning LLMs is resource consuming.
Moreover,LLMsaregenerallypre-trainedongenericdatasets,
so they often fall short when performing zero-shot tasks
in specific domains, such as cybersecurity. Second, the
document-to-summary compression ratio on the two tasks
are 14.32 (2865.60 / 200.04) and 22.23 (2865.60/118.27),
respectively (details in Table 1). The high compression ra-
tio shows competitiveness with the current long document
summarization datasets, requiring systems to be extremely
preciseincapturingonlythemostrelevantfactsfromlengthy
documents in a minimal number of words. Finally, CTISum
has another subtask, APS, which means the system should
be capable of the ability to capture the fine-grained attack
process described in CTI reports.
To demonstrate the challenges posed by the proposed
CTISum dataset, we conduct comprehensive experiments
comparingarange ofextractiveand abstractivesummariza-
tion methods. The automatic and human evaluation indicate
that existing approaches still have considerable limitations
on the CTISum. The extractive methods struggle to identify
salient information from lengthy and complex documents.
They tend to produce incomplete summaries. Abstractive
techniquesfacechallengesingeneratingcoherentandnon-redundant summaries, as well as avoiding hallucinations.

2.1. Text Summarization
A considerable amount of existing researches in auto-
matictextsummarization[ 35,28,27,4,18,44]haveexplored
toimprovesummarygenerationfornewsarticles,usingpopu-
lardatasetssuchasCNN/DailyMail[ 28],XSum[ 29],etc. In
addition, scientific document summarization has emerged as
another critical area, with datasets based on ArXiv/PubMed
[8], and other academic sources. The main approaches cover
two aspects. First, extractive methods [ 13,5,45,21,22,44]
involve identifying and extracting key sentences or passages
from the original text to form the summary. For instance,
Liu et al. [ 22] introduce a document-level encoder based on
BERTandproposeageneralframeworkforsummarization.
Second, abstractive techniques focus on generating new sen-
tencestocapturethemeaningofthesourcetext. Forexample,
sequence-to-sequence models with attention [ 25,27,31] are
usuallyutilizedtogeneratetheprobabilitydistributionson
thevocabulary. Inaddition,Seeetal. [ 37]presentahybrid
pointer generator architecture for abstractive summarization.
Andmorerecently,transformer-basedmodelslikeT5[ 34],
BART [19] and Longformer[ 3] have shown advanced perfor-
mance on the summarization task.
Althoughcurrentgeneralsummarizationtechniqueshave
madesomeprogress,theirperformancesignificantlydecrease
when transferred to CTI summarization tasks due to the lack
of domain-specific fine-tuning data. The creation of the
CTISumcouldprovideanessentialresourcefordomainadap-
tation, as well as developing and evaluating domain-specific
summarization approaches.

3. Data Construction
AsshowninFigure2,theproposedmulti-stageannota-
tion pipeline consists of four stages. The first stage is col-
lectingdatafromdiversewebsources,namelyopensource
report [10], threat encyclopedia [ 2], and security company
report[1]toensurethediversityandcoverage. Thesecondstage is parsing and cleaning which aims to parse original
PDFreportsintoreadabletext,thenobtainhigh-qualityinput
data by manually cleaning and filtering. Next follows the
promptschemastage,wheredomainexpertsdesignvarious
prompts based on different tasks, to fully utilize the pow-
erful text generation capabilities of LLMs and prepare for
the annotation. Finally, the intelligence summarization stage.
To combine system productivity and expert experience ef-
ficiently, we transform the manual annotation process into
rankingandclassifying,havingexpertsreviewandrankthe
outputs of LLMs to obtain the final summary. Next, we first
introduce the multi-stage annotation pipeline, and then make
a statistics and analysis of the CTISum.
3.1. The Multi-stage Annotation Pipeline
The multi-stage annotation pipeline focuses on obtaining
the high-qualityCTISum dataset, wherewe attempt to com-
bine the strengths of both expert experience and LLMs (like
GPT-4 [30] orClaude2 or 3.5[ 6]) toachieve semi-automatic
summarization annotation for efficiency in the cybersecurity
domain.
Stage 1: Data Collecting. To gather relevant CTI reports
andbuild CTISum,weuse thereportsscrapedfrom diverse
web sources, including web open source report like APT-
notes1, threat encyclopedia like Trendmicro2, and security

companyreportlikeSymantec3toensurethediversityand
coverage of the CTISum. The range of collected data is cov-
ered from 2016 to 2024. For the summarization tasks, a
balanced dataset of 1,345 documents is sampled and anno-
tated with two categories: CTIS and APS.
Stage 2: Parsing and Cleaning. Inordertoobtainhigh-
quality input data, the second stage focuses more on parsing
and further cleaning the parsed text.
Given that CTI reports are currently formatted as PDF
files, which have complex structure and cannot be directly
usedastheinputtothesystem,onenecessarystepistoparse
the PDFs and extract readable text. Specifically, the gath-
eredPDFsarefirstlyfilteredtoonlyincludethosecontaining
actual text content, rather than scanned documents which
cannotbeparsedbycertaintoolslikePDFMiner. Then,an
off-the-shelfPDFparsinglibrary4isleveragedtoprogram-
maticallyextractthereadabletextfromeachdocument,while
figuresarediscarded. Finally,theoutputtextissavedinTXT
format, allowing transferability to downstream systems.
After parsing, it is indispensable to clean and filter the
extractedtextforhigh-qualityinputdatatotheLLMs. This
post-processing helps improve the quality and consistency
of the textualdata. One methodology isto manually review
samples of the extracted text to identify issues that need to
be cleaned. Some rules are:
•Correcting encoding issues when parsing error.
•Removingblanklinesandoddcharactersthatgetex-
tracted but provide no value.
•Cleaning up irregular textlike ellipses and page num-
bers that are extracted from tables of contents, lists,
etc.
•Removing non-English and useless characters.
•Deduplicatingandremovingstringslikelongsequences
of consecutive IP addresses, hashes, etc.
•Filteringwithregularexpressions. DetailsinAppendix
A.2.
The parsing and cleaning stage ensures higher quality
input text for the next stage of analysis and annotation.
Stage 3: Prompt Schema. The purpose of this stage is
to develop a detailed prompt schema to guide the LLMs
(Claude2 or 3.5, ChatGLM3, etc.) in producing candidate
summaries,suchashighlightingkeyeventsandsummarizing
reports, attack processes, some useful annotations, etc. To
generateaccurateandconsistentsummariesfortheCTIStask
andtheAPStask,CTIexpertsanalyzetheparsedandcleaned

cess prompt schema, respectively. As shown in Figure 2,
several key annotation prompts are defined as follows:

Stage 4: Intelligence Summarization. Tocombinesys-
temproductivity andexpert experiencemoreefficiently,we
transform the manual annotation process into ranking and
classifying model-generated results, having three experts re-
view and rank the outputs into overall summaries. Specifi-
cally,LLMslikeGPT-4o[ 30],Claude2or3.5[ 6],ChatGLM3
[42]are leveraged togenerate multiplecoarse-grained sum-
maries for the proposed two tasks. Then, three domain ex-
perts are involved in reviewing and ranking the candidate
summaries, discussing and selecting the better content to
combine into a final gold summary. If the generated sum-
mariesturnouttobeinadequate,theexamplewouldbedis-
carded. The domain experts play a key role in evaluating
and improving the model-generated summaries to produce a
high-quality benchmark. Their human judgment and domain
expertise complement the capabilities of LLMs. This collab-
orativehuman-AIapproachallowsthecreationofabstractive
summaries that are coherent, relevant, and accurate.
3.2. Data Statistics
Table 1 describes the statistics of the CTISum dataset
and existing summarization datasets from different domains.
The datasets are divided into general and specific domain
categories, with the latter attracting substantial interest in re-
centyearsfrom2021to2024. Andwemakethefirstattempt
to build the CTI summarization dataset in the cybersecurity
domain. Specifically, CTISum has 1,345 documents from
diverse web sources, with an average document length of
2,865 words, with an average CTI summary length of 200
words, and with a high compression ratio of 14.32. Notably,
CTISum is the only dataset with the subtask, while other
datasets simply make a general summary of the document.
The average length of the attack process summaries is about
118words,whichisshorterthanthegeneralsummaries. This

task is to generate a summary of the attack process.
5. Experiments
5.1. Evaluation Metrics
In this section, the automatic and human A/B evaluation
are considered to validate the performance of the current
SOTA models.
Followingpapers[ 15,26],BERTScore[ 43]andROUGE-
𝑛(R-𝑛)[20]aretakenasevaluationmetrics,whicharewidely
usedforevaluatingthequalityofsummarization. BERTScore
is a metric for evaluating text generation models, which mea-
sures the similarity between the generated text and reference
text using contextual embeddings from pre-trained BERT.
ROUGE-𝑛refers to the overlap of n-grams between the gen-
erated and reference summaries. Specifically, ROUGE- 1
evaluatesunigramoverlap,ROUGE- 2measuresbigramover-
lap, and ROUGE- 𝐿calculates longest common subsequence
overlap. Thesemetricscomparematchingunitssuchaswords
and phrases between the generated and reference summaries,
with higher scores indicating better summarization quality.
Among the ROUGE metrics, ROUGE- 𝐿generally corre-
sponds best with human judgments of summary quality.In previous studies, human evaluation is usually con-
ducted by crowdsourcing workers who rate responses on
ascalefrom1to5fromtheaspectsofcorrectness,relevancy,
etc. However, the criteria can vary widely between differ-
ent individuals. Therefore, this study adopts the human A/B
evaluation for a high inter-annotator agreement. Given the
generated summaries of two models A and B, three analysts
are prompted togo through an entire CTI reportand choose
thebetteroneforeachofthe80randomlysub-sampledtest
instances. For objectivity, annotators include those with and
withoutbackgroundknowledge(task-related). Thefinalre-
sults are determined by majority voting. If the three anno-
tatorsreachdifferentconclusions,thefourthannotatorwill
be brought in. We adopt the same human evaluation with
paper[26]: 1)FactualCorrectness: whichsummarycanbe
supported by the source CTI report? 2) Relevance: which
summarycapturespertinentinformationrelativetotheCTI
report? 3)Coverage: whichsummarycontainsthegreatest
coverage of relevant content in the CTI report?
5.2. Experimental Setting

Extractive Model Extractive summarization involves se-
lecting a subset of salient sentences, phrases, or words from
the original document to form the summary. The key idea
is to identify and extract the most important content, and
thenarrangeextractedcontenttoflowlogically. Wesimply
introduce some methods as follows.
BertSumExt [ 22] is a neural extractive summarization
model based on BERT [ 11], which takes BERT as the sen-
tenceencoderandaTransformerlayerasthedocumenten-
coder. Aclassifierisutilizedtoperformsentenceselection,
then the model outputs the final summary.
MatchSum [ 44] formulates the extractive summarization
task as a semantic text matching problem and develops a
novelsummary-levelframeworkMatchSum,whichgenerates
acollectionofpossiblecandidatesummariesfromtheoutput
of BertSumEXT. The candidate that matches best with the
document is selected as the final summarized version.Abstractive Model Abstractive summarization involves
generatingnewphrasesandsentencesthatconveythemost
importantinformationfromthesourcedocument,whichuses
semantic understanding and language generation technology
tomakeasummarization. Hence,wefine-tuneBART[ 19]
and T5 [34] from the HuggingFace library.
BART [19] is an encoder-decoder language model based
onasequence-to-sequencearchitecture,whichachievesstrong
performanceonavarietyofNLPtaskslikesummarization,
question answering and text generation after fine-tuning.
T5 [34] uses a standard Transformer encoder-decoder
architecture, which converts all NLP tasks into a unified text-
to-text format where the input and output are always text
strings. T5 comes in several sizes including T5-Small, T5-
Base, T5-Large, etc. In this paper, the setting is based on
T5-Base.

language model, which is trained on massive text datasets
tolearnnaturallanguagepatternsandgeneratehuman-like
text. The context length of LLAMA2 can extend up to 4096
tokens, allowing it to understand and generate longer texts.

5.4. Main Results
Automatic Evaluation. We compare the performance of
extractive models, abstractive models and long-document-
based models on CTIS and APS tasks. As depicted in Ta-
ble 2, extractive models perform the almost worst on both
tasks,demonstratingthatintelligencesummarizationincy-
bersecurityinvolvesmorethanjustextractingsentences. In-
terestingly, they obtain the best BERTScore, one possible
reason is that these two models are based on BERT, leading
to high BERTScore. Compared with MatchSum, abstractive
model like BART-large (about 374M) achieves better result,
about 10.12% and 6.18% gain on ROUGE-L on two tasks,
which shows that the abstractive models are more suitable
forthesetwotasks. Then,long-document-basedmodellike
Longformer(102M)obtainssimilarresultscomparedwith
BART-base (about 121M). Notably, LLAMA2-7B and GPT-
4o (zero-shot) do not attain further improvement on all the
evaluationmetrics,leavingnoticeableroomforfuturework
on domain LLMs fine-tuning and few-shot learning on the
benchmark. Finally, we find that performance is worse on
theAPStask,likelybecausetheattackprocessexhibitsprop-
ertieslikevariability,concealmentandcomplexity,making
APS more challenging than general summarization. Enhanc-
ingmodelsforAPStaskremainsanimportantdirectionfor

uation,humanA/Bevaluation[ 32]isconductedtovalidate

5.5. Fleiss Kappa Analysis
Toverifytheconsistencyofthefinalsummarygeneration
quality, we select 5 experts to execute a consistency evalu-
ation of 50 sampled summaries using Fleiss Kappa, where
the scores are rated from 1 to 5, with 1 very negative, 2 neg-
ative, 3 neutral, 4 positive, and 5 very positive. As shown
intheTable4, thefinalFleissKappascoreis0.37, indicat-
ing relatively low agreement. This can be attributed to the
factthatsummarygenerationbelongstolanguagegeneration
task, where different experts tend to have subjective views
on summary quality (e.g., examples that annotated as posi-
tiveorverypositiveareinconsistent,buttheyareallgood),
which differs greatly from the objectivity of classification
tasks. However, we also analyze the score distribution of all
experts, finding that summaries rated 3 or above account for
96.4%(241/250)ofthetotal,demonstratingthatthequalityof
the annotated dataset is controllable and accurate. Moreover,
we have conduct another round of Fleiss Kappa Analysis on
the previous annotation scores from multiple raters. Specifi-
cally, we combine score 1 and 2 into one bin, keep score 3
as a separate bin, and combine score 4 and 5 into another
bin. ThisresultinaFleissKappascoreof0.613184,which
indicate the consistency evaluation.

purpose of using base model is to train the model quickly)
on CTI and APS tasks. We divide the different length to
getbetterinsightintothecurrentmodels. AsshowninFig-
ure 3, where the x-axis represents the input length and the
y-axis denotes the measure value of evaluation metrics. The
conclusionscanbedrawn: 1)Astheinputlengthincreases,
the modelperformance improves steadily, highlightingthe
model’s ability to processand summarize longer sequences.
2) As the length of BART reaches 1024 tokens, performance
on our tasks continues to improve. To further investigate the
impact of longer length, we increase the size of Longformer
and find that lengthening to 3500tokens(75th percentile of
length distribution) results in optimal performance, which
suggests the advantage of long-distance modeling. 3) The
model achieves poorer performance on the APS task com-
pared to the CTIS task, indicating it struggles more with
summarizing technical attack details than threat intelligence
reports. In summary, the experiments provide insight into
current models’ ability to capture long-distance dependen-
cies in documents and summarize essential information as
the input size varies. Further work could focus on improving
themodel’sabilityoflengthtoboostperformanceonlengthy,
technical summarization tasks.5.7. Few-shot Analysis
Analyzing the impact of data size can help to understand
therelationshipbetweendatasizeandsummarizingperfor-
mance. To demonstrate such a relationship, in this section,
few-shot analysis experiments on BART-base are conducted
to study model’s sensitivity in different training data sizes.
Weexperimentwith10%,25%,40%,55%,70%,and100%
of the total training data to analyze the impact on CTIS task
and APS task. The experimental results are shown in the
Figure 4 with several conclusions: 1) Performance of BART-
baseimproves asthetrainingdata sizeincreases,indicating
thatmodelqualitybenefitsfrommoreabundanttrainingdata.
Furthermore,theresultinthefigureisstillgrowing,which
suggests further improvements with larger training data size.
2) Performance on the APS task is worse than the CTIS task,
especially in few shot setting (e.g., 10%, 25%). Therefore,
howtoimprovetheperformanceofsummarizationmodels
in few-shot setting for cybersecurity domain will be an im-
portant future research track. And data augmentation is also
another area worth researching.

A.2. Details of Regular Expression
During the process of filtering and cleaning the parsed
PDF data, in order to reduce the burden of manual checking
by annotators, we first sample and observe 50 examples, and
then extract some common features to formulate into regular
expressions for automatically cleaning the data. Specifically,
details of regular expression are in the following:
•Removing consecutive dots (table of contents)
•Deleting redundant newlines/carriage returns
•Removing extra whitespace between characters
•Deleting multiple consecutive lines of IP addresses,
hashes, etc.
•Removing website links starting with “http”
•RemovingThai,Koreanandothernon-Englishcharac-
ters
By automating the cleaning of patterns and noise with regex,
we aim to improve efficiency and reduce manual effort. The
regular expressions are tuned iteratively based on continu-
ously sampling and inspecting. This method allows us to
programmatically clean a significant portion of repetitive is-
sues in parsed PDF data before manual review. In the future,

ternstocleanthedata. Thegoalistominimizetheamount
