Compliance standards, such as GDPR, play a crucial role in deploying AI solutions securely and legally soundly. AI systems often process large amounts of personal data, making them subject to data protection regulations.

Here are some key considerations:

1. Data Protection by Design and by Default: AI systems should be designed with privacy in mind from the outset. This means implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data, such as data minimization","Compliance standards are critical in AI deployments because they shape the policies and controls applied to data handling. Under regulations like the GDPR, organizations must ensure personal information is used responsibly, reinforcing data minimization, consent management, and the right to be forgotten. For an AI model, this influences data retention policies, meaning developers must securely remove or anonymize data once it has served its training purpose. Compliance frameworks also mandate breach notification procedures, compelling prompt reporting if sensitive information is compromised. Beyond legal requirements, adhering to these standards instills consumer and stakeholder trust, which is vital for any AI-driven service.

Inference attacks are a type of adversarial attack that aims to extract confidential information about the training data or the underlying model architecture of a machine learning model. Here are some strategies to detect and counter inference attacks:

1. Differential Privacy: Add noise to the model's output to prevent the extraction of sensitive information about individual training examples. This technique adds a level of uncertainty to the model's predictions, making it harder for an attacker to infer information","One effective countermeasure is to monitor the frequency and nature of queries made to the model's API. Excessive or statistically unusual query patterns may indicate a malicious actor attempting to reverse-engineer the model.

How to avoid ARP poisoning?,"How to avoid ARP poisoning?

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) poisoning is a type of attack that can be used to intercept network traffic. To avoid ARP poisoning, you can take the following steps:

1. Use a static ARP table: Instead of relying on the dynamic ARP table maintained by your operating system, you can manually configure the ARP table to map IP addresses to MAC addresses. This can help prevent ARP poisoning because an attacker would need to update","Following are the five ways of avoiding ARP Poisoning attacks: -Static ARP Tables: If you can verify the correct mapping of MAC addresses to IP addresses, half the problem is solved. This is doable but very costly to administer. ARP tables to record all associations and each network change are manually updated in these tables. Currently, it is not practical for an organization to manually update its ARP table on every host. -Switch Security: Most Ethernet switches have features that help mitigate ARP poisoning attacks. Also known as Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI), these features help validate ARP messages and drop packets that indicate any kind of malicious activity. -Physical Security: A very simple way to mitigate ARP poisoning attacks is to control the physical space of your organization. ARP messages are only routed within the local network. Therefore, an attacker may have physical proximity to the victim's network. -Network Isolation: A well-segmented network is better than a regular network because ARP messages have a range no wider than the local subnet. That way, if an attack were to occur, only parts of the network would be affected and other parts would be safe. Attacks on one subnet do not affect devices on other subnets. -Encryption: Encryption does not help prevent ARP poisoning, but it does help reduce the damage that could be done if an attack were to occur. Credentials are stolen from the network, similar to the MiTM attack.",0.8091263771057129,0.0040954158211028505,0.1589154750108719

What steps would you take to reduce false positives in IDS alerts?,"What steps would you take to reduce false positives in IDS alerts?

False positives in IDS (Intrusion Detection System) alerts can be reduced by implementing the following steps:

1. Baseline Establishment: Establish a baseline of normal network traffic patterns. This can be done by collecting and analyzing network traffic data over a period of time.

2. Signature Tuning: Adjust the IDS signatures to better match the network environment. This can be done by modifying the sensitivity of the sign","False positives can overwhelm security teams, waste time, and hide real threats. The goal is to tune the system so it detects real threats, not routine business activity, without suppressing anything important. Here's how you'd approach that: Prioritize the noisiest rules Start by identifying which signatures are firing the most. For example, maybe a rule is flagging internal vulnerability scans as port scans, or triggering on encrypted traffic that can't be inspected. Group alerts by signature ID, source, and destination so you can focus on what's creating the most noise. Understand the traffic and business context Work with IT or networking teams to understand what that traffic actually is. Maybe a daily database backup to cloud storage is triggering a data exfiltration alert. Or maybe an in-house monitoring tool is sending pings that the IDS interprets as a reconnaissance scan. If you don't understand what ""normal"" looks like, you'll keep chasing harmless events. Tune the rules This is where you adjust the logic of the rule: Add exceptions based on IP address or port (e.g. exclude internal tools or trusted services) Modify the pattern to be more specific (e.g. match only on a certain payload size or header) Tighten the time window or event threshold (e.g. only trigger on 5+ failed logins within 60 seconds) In tools like Snort or Suricata, this often means editing rule files directly or writing suppression rules. In commercial tools, it may involve using built-in filters or UI-based rule editors. Layer in contextual detection If your IDS supports it, integrate threat intelligence, geolocation, or asset criticality. For example, you might accept certain traffic from internal dev systems but alert if the same activity comes from a public IP or hits a production database. Test, monitor, and iterate After tuning, test against both real traffic and simulated attacks. Did you eliminate noise without silencing something important? Add logging to track suppression hits over time so you can revisit them if behavior changes. Document everything False positive tuning decisions should be recorded: what was changed, why it was safe, and who approved it. This helps with audits, team transparency, and long-term tuning hygiene. Why interviewers ask this They're testing whether you understand the balance between visibility and signal quality. Anyone can say ""tune the IDS,"" but they're looking for someone who can explain how to do it, why it's necessary, and how not to break detection in the process. So if you can talk through real examples of reducing alert fatigue while preserving coverage, it shows you're ready to own part of the detection engineering pipeline.",0.6591308116912842,0.00015775559284371524,-0.057809434831142426

Use SIEM logs, endpoint data, alerts, and timestamps from involved systems to create a reliable sequence of events. Trace the initial access point Figure out how the attacker got in. Was it a phishing email, a vulnerable public-facing service, stolen credentials, or insider activity? Look for signs in web logs, firewall rules, email headers, or authentication logs. Map the attack path What did the attacker do once inside? Did they move laterally, escalate privileges, or access sensitive data? Use endpoint telemetry, command histories, or file access logs to recreate their movements. Pay close attention to what tools or scripts they used. Identify what failed This is the actual ""root cause."" Was it a missing patch, poor logging, overly permissive access, or lack of monitoring? You're looking for the underlying gap in controls or process that made the attack possible or allowed it to escalate. Document the findings Write a clear, structured report that explains the timeline, impact, and root cause in plain language.
