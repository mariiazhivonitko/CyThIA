Under regulations like the GDPR, organizations must ensure personal information is used responsibly, reinforcing data minimization, consent management, and the right to be forgotten. For an AI model, this influences data retention policies, meaning developers must securely remove or anonymize data once it has served its training purpose. Compliance frameworks also mandate breach notification procedures, compelling prompt reporting if sensitive information is compromised. Beyond legal requirements, adhering to these standards instills consumer and stakeholder trust, which is vital for any AI-driven service. By rigorously following data protection regulations, organizations avoid hefty fines and build robust guardrails that reduce risks of unauthorized disclosures or ethical breaches.",0.8432580828666687,0.015675284282811335,0.14497122168540955

How to avoid ARP poisoning?,"How to avoid ARP poisoning? Here are some ways to protect your network from ARP spoofing.
ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a fundamental protocol in the TCP/IP stack that allows devices on a local network to learn the MAC (Media Access Control) addresses of other devices. ARP poisoning is a type of cyber attack that involves intercepting and altering ARP requests and responses to associate a fake MAC address with an IP address.
ARP poisoning is a type of man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack that allows an attacker to intercept and","Following are the five ways of avoiding ARP Poisoning attacks: -Static ARP Tables: If you can verify the correct mapping of MAC addresses to IP addresses, half the problem is solved. This is doable but very costly to administer. ARP tables to record all associations and each network change are manually updated in these tables. Currently, it is not practical for an organization to manually update its ARP table on every host. -Switch Security: Most Ethernet switches have features that help mitigate ARP poisoning attacks. Also known as Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI), these features help validate ARP messages and drop packets that indicate any kind of malicious activity. -Physical Security: A very simple way to mitigate ARP poisoning attacks is to control the physical space of your organization. ARP messages are only routed within the local network. Therefore, an attacker may have physical proximity to the victim's network. -Network Isolation: A well-segmented network is better than a regular network because ARP messages have a range no wider than the local subnet. That way, if an attack were to occur, only parts of the network would be affected and other parts would be safe. Attacks on one subnet do not affect devices on other subnets. -Encryption: Encryption does not help prevent ARP poisoning, but it does help reduce the damage that could be done if an attack were to occur. Credentials are stolen from the network, similar to the MiTM attack.",0.7803896069526672,0.0024661302267017593,0.05440883710980415

What steps would you take to reduce false positives in IDS alerts?,"What steps would you take to reduce false positives in IDS alerts??
To reduce false positives in IDS (Intrusion Detection System) alerts, you can take several steps:
1.  **Tuning the IDS rules**: Adjusting the sensitivity of the IDS rules can help reduce false positives. You can set the rules to be more specific and only trigger on specific patterns or anomalies.
2.  **Implementing whitelisting**: Creating a whitelist of known good traffic can help the IDS ignore legitimate traffic and only alert on unknown or suspicious activity.
3. ","False positives can overwhelm security teams, waste time, and hide real threats. The goal is to tune the system so it detects real threats, not routine business activity, without suppressing anything important. Here's how you'd approach that: Prioritize the noisiest rules Start by identifying which signatures are firing the most. For example, maybe a rule is flagging internal vulnerability scans as port scans, or triggering on encrypted traffic that can't be inspected. Group alerts by signature ID, source, and destination so you can focus on what's creating the most noise. Understand the traffic and business context Work with IT or networking teams to understand what that traffic actually is. Maybe a daily database backup to cloud storage is triggering a data exfiltration alert. Or maybe an in-house monitoring tool is sending pings that the IDS interprets as a reconnaissance scan. If you don't understand what ""normal"" looks like, you'll keep chasing harmless events. Tune the rules This is where you adjust the logic of the rule: Add exceptions based on IP address or port (e.g. exclude internal tools or trusted services) Modify the pattern to be more specific (e.g. match only on a certain payload size or header) Tighten the time window or event threshold (e.g. only trigger on 5+ failed logins within 60 seconds) In tools like Snort or Suricata, this often means editing rule files directly or writing suppression rules. In commercial tools, it may involve using built-in filters or UI-based rule editors. Layer in contextual detection If your IDS supports it, integrate threat intelligence, geolocation, or asset criticality. For example, you might accept certain traffic from internal dev systems but alert if the same activity comes from a public IP or hits a production database. Test, monitor, and iterate After tuning, test against both real traffic and simulated attacks. Did you eliminate noise without silencing something important? Add logging to track suppression hits over time so you can revisit them if behavior changes. Document everything False positive tuning decisions should be recorded: what was changed, why it was safe, and who approved it. This helps with audits, team transparency, and long-term tuning hygiene. Why interviewers ask this They're testing whether you understand the balance between visibility and signal quality. Anyone can say ""tune the IDS,"" but they're looking for someone who can explain how to do it, why it's necessary, and how not to break detection in the process. So if you can talk through real examples of reducing alert fatigue while preserving coverage, it shows you're ready to own part of the detection engineering pipeline.",0.6316465735435486,0.0013337383835901042,-0.013998634181916714

How would you perform a root cause analysis after a security incident?,"How would you perform a root cause analysis after a security incident? - 2023
A root cause analysis (RCA) is a systematic approach to identifying the underlying causes of a security incident. The goal of an RCA is to identify the root cause of the incident, which is the underlying reason or set of reasons that led to the incident.

","Root cause analysis (RCA) is about understanding why an incident happened and not just what it was. It's how security teams move from reacting to a current issue to preventing future ones, by identifying the real weakness that let the incident occur and making sure it doesn't happen again. Here's how a solid RCA typically unfolds: Confirm the timeline Start by establishing when the incident began, when it was detected, and when it was contained. Use SIEM logs, endpoint data, alerts, and timestamps from involved systems to create a reliable sequence of events. Trace the initial access point Figure out how the attacker got in. Was it a phishing email, a vulnerable public-facing service, stolen credentials, or insider activity? Look for signs in web logs, firewall rules, email headers, or authentication logs. Map the attack path What did the attacker do once inside? Did they move laterally, escalate privileges, or access sensitive data? Use endpoint telemetry, command histories, or file access logs to recreate their movements. Pay close attention to what tools or scripts they used. Identify what failed This is the actual ""root cause."" Was it a missing patch, poor logging, overly permissive access, or lack of monitoring? You're looking for the underlying gap in controls or process that made the attack possible or allowed it to escalate. Document the findings Write a clear, structured report that explains the timeline, impact, and root cause in plain language. Include any assumptions made, evidence collected, and technical indicators. Your report may also go to non-technical stakeholders, so clarity matters. Recommend corrective actions RCA is only useful if it leads to change. That might mean improving detection rules, tightening access policies, patching systems, updating response procedures, or training staff. Why interviewers ask this They want to know if you think beyond alerts and symptoms, so if you can walk through how you'd reconstruct an attack, isolate the true cause, and help the team learn from it, you're showing you're ready to contribute at a higher level, not just react to alarms.",0.7438539862632751,0.004540809405265237,0.05145252123475075
