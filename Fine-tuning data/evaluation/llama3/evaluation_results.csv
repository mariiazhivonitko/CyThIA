How to avoid ARP poisoning?,"How to avoid ARP poisoning? - ARP spoofing prevention
ARP poisoning, also known as ARP spoofing, is a type of cyber attack where an attacker sends fake ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages to a network, tricking devices into thinking that the attacker's MAC (Media Access Control) address is the address of a trusted device, such as a router or a switch.
To avoid ARP poisoning, you can use the following methods:
1. Use a switch instead of a hub: Switches are more secure than hubs because","Following are the five ways of avoiding ARP Poisoning attacks: -Static ARP Tables: If you can verify the correct mapping of MAC addresses to IP addresses, half the problem is solved. This is doable but very costly to administer. ARP tables to record all associations and each network change are manually updated in these tables. Currently, it is not practical for an organization to manually update its ARP table on every host. -Switch Security: Most Ethernet switches have features that help mitigate ARP poisoning attacks. Also known as Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI), these features help validate ARP messages and drop packets that indicate any kind of malicious activity. -Physical Security: A very simple way to mitigate ARP poisoning attacks is to control the physical space of your organization. ARP messages are only routed within the local network. Therefore, an attacker may have physical proximity to the victim's network. -Network Isolation: A well-segmented network is better than a regular network because ARP messages have a range no wider than the local subnet. That way, if an attack were to occur, only parts of the network would be affected and other parts would be safe. Attacks on one subnet do not affect devices on other subnets. -Encryption: Encryption does not help prevent ARP poisoning, but it does help reduce the damage that could be done if an attack were to occur. Credentials are stolen from the network, similar to the MiTM attack.",0.7221686244010925,0.0021324355765933206,0.08161114156246185

What steps would you take to reduce false positives in IDS alerts?,"What steps would you take to reduce false positives in IDS alerts? 1) Filter out known good traffic 2) Implement a signature update 3)  Analyze traffic patterns and adjust thresholds 4)  All of the above
A. 1
B.  2
C.  3
D.  4
Answer: D
Explanation: IDS false positives can be reduced by filtering out known good traffic, implementing a signature update, and analyzing traffic patterns and adjusting thresholds. Filtering out known good traffic can eliminate traffic","False positives can overwhelm security teams, waste time, and hide real threats. The goal is to tune the system so it detects real threats, not routine business activity, without suppressing anything important. Here's how you'd approach that: Prioritize the noisiest rules Start by identifying which signatures are firing the most. For example, maybe a rule is flagging internal vulnerability scans as port scans, or triggering on encrypted traffic that can't be inspected. Group alerts by signature ID, source, and destination so you can focus on what's creating the most noise. Understand the traffic and business context Work with IT or networking teams to understand what that traffic actually is. Maybe a daily database backup to cloud storage is triggering a data exfiltration alert. Or maybe an in-house monitoring tool is sending pings that the IDS interprets as a reconnaissance scan. If you don't understand what ""normal"" looks like, you'll keep chasing harmless events. Tune the rules This is where you adjust the logic of the rule: Add exceptions based on IP address or port (e.g. exclude internal tools or trusted services) Modify the pattern to be more specific (e.g. match only on a certain payload size or header) Tighten the time window or event threshold (e.g. only trigger on 5+ failed logins within 60 seconds) In tools like Snort or Suricata, this often means editing rule files directly or writing suppression rules. In commercial tools, it may involve using built-in filters or UI-based rule editors. Layer in contextual detection If your IDS supports it, integrate threat intelligence, geolocation, or asset criticality. For example, you might accept certain traffic from internal dev systems but alert if the same activity comes from a public IP or hits a production database. Test, monitor, and iterate After tuning, test against both real traffic and simulated attacks. Did you eliminate noise without silencing something important? Add logging to track suppression hits over time so you can revisit them if behavior changes. Document everything False positive tuning decisions should be recorded: what was changed, why it was safe, and who approved it. This helps with audits, team transparency, and long-term tuning hygiene. Why interviewers ask this They're testing whether you understand the balance between visibility and signal quality. Anyone can say ""tune the IDS,"" but they're looking for someone who can explain how to do it, why it's necessary, and how not to break detection in the process. So if you can talk through real examples of reducing alert fatigue while preserving coverage, it shows you're ready to own part of the detection engineering pipeline.",0.6571837663650513,0.00011521180294987116,-0.23313350975513458

	* System logs
	* Network traffic captures
	* User accounts and access logs
	* Security event logs
	* Interviews with affected personnel

It's how security teams move from reacting to a current issue to preventing future ones, by identifying the real weakness that let the incident occur and making sure it doesn't happen again. Here's how a solid RCA typically unfolds: Confirm the timeline Start by establishing when the incident began, when it was detected, and when it was contained. Use SIEM logs, endpoint data, alerts, and timestamps from involved systems to create a reliable sequence of events. Trace the initial access point Figure out how the attacker got in. Was it a phishing email, a vulnerable public-facing service, stolen credentials, or insider activity? Look for signs in web logs, firewall rules, email headers, or authentication logs. Map the attack path What did the attacker do once inside? Did they move laterally, escalate privileges, or access sensitive data? Use endpoint telemetry, command histories, or file access logs to recreate their movements. Pay close attention to what tools or scripts they used. Identify what failed This is the actual ""root cause."" Was it a missing patch, poor logging, overly permissive access, or lack of monitoring? You're looking for the underlying gap in controls or process that made the attack possible or allowed it to escalate. Document the findings Write a clear, structured report that explains the timeline, impact, and root cause in plain language. Include any assumptions made, evidence collected, and technical indicators. Your report may also go to non-technical stakeholders, so clarity matters. Recommend corrective actions RCA is only useful if it leads to change. That might mean improving detection rules, tightening access policies, patching systems, updating response procedures, or training staff.

Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) is a cryptographic technique used to ensure that each session key is unique and cannot be compromised even if the private key of a user or server is compromised. In other words, it ensures that even if an attacker gains access to the private key of a user or server, they will not be able to decrypt any previous or future sessions.

Suppose Alice and Bob want to communicate","Perfect Forward Secrecy is a style of encryption that creates a temporary exchange of secret keys between the server and client. It is primarily used to call apps, websites, and messaging apps where user privacy is paramount. A new session key is generated each time the user performs an action. This keeps your data uncompromised and safe from attackers. This is separate from special keys. The basic idea behind Perfect Forward Secrecy technology is to generate a new encryption key each time a user initiates a session. So, if only the encryption key is compromised, the conversation is leaked, and if the user's unique key is compromised, the conversation will continue. Encryption keys generated by Perfect Forward Secrecy keep you safe from attackers.
