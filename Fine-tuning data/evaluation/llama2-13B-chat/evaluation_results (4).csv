How to avoid ARP poisoning?,"How to avoid ARP poisoning?

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) poisoning is a type of attack where an attacker sends fake ARP messages to associate an attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device on a network. This can cause traffic intended for the legitimate device to be sent to the attacker instead. Here are some ways to avoid ARP poisoning:

1. Use static ARP mapping: Instead of using dynamic ARP mapping, use static AR","Following are the five ways of avoiding ARP Poisoning attacks: -Static ARP Tables: If you can verify the correct mapping of MAC addresses to IP addresses, half the problem is solved. This is doable but very costly to administer. ARP tables to record all associations and each network change are manually updated in these tables. Currently, it is not practical for an organization to manually update its ARP table on every host. -Switch Security: Most Ethernet switches have features that help mitigate ARP poisoning attacks. Also known as Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI), these features help validate ARP messages and drop packets that indicate any kind of malicious activity. -Physical Security: A very simple way to mitigate ARP poisoning attacks is to control the physical space of your organization. ARP messages are only routed within the local network. Therefore, an attacker may have physical proximity to the victim's network. -Network Isolation: A well-segmented network is better than a regular network because ARP messages have a range no wider than the local subnet. That way, if an attack were to occur, only parts of the network would be affected and other parts would be safe. Attacks on one subnet do not affect devices on other subnets. -Encryption: Encryption does not help prevent ARP poisoning, but it does help reduce the damage that could be done if an attack were to occur. Credentials are stolen from the network, similar to the MiTM attack.",0.7487502694129944,0.0016259453982714598,0.09424833208322525,0.3125,0.08176100628930817,0.15

What steps would you take to reduce false positives in IDS alerts?,"What steps would you take to reduce false positives in IDS alerts?

IDS (Intrusion Detection System) alerts are an essential component of any organization's security posture. However, false positives can lead to unnecessary noise and distractions, potentially causing security teams to overlook real threats. Here are some steps you can take to reduce false positives in IDS alerts:

1. Tuning the IDS system: One of the most effective ways to reduce false positives is to tune the ID","False positives can overwhelm security teams, waste time, and hide real threats. The goal is to tune the system so it detects real threats, not routine business activity, without suppressing anything important. Here's how you'd approach that: Prioritize the noisiest rules Start by identifying which signatures are firing the most. For example, maybe a rule is flagging internal vulnerability scans as port scans, or triggering on encrypted traffic that can't be inspected. Group alerts by signature ID, source, and destination so you can focus on what's creating the most noise. Understand the traffic and business context Work with IT or networking teams to understand what that traffic actually is. Maybe a daily database backup to cloud storage is triggering a data exfiltration alert. Or maybe an in-house monitoring tool is sending pings that the IDS interprets as a reconnaissance scan. If you don't understand what ""normal"" looks like, you'll keep chasing harmless events. Tune the rules This is where you adjust the logic of the rule: Add exceptions based on IP address or port (e.g. exclude internal tools or trusted services) Modify the pattern to be more specific (e.g. match only on a certain payload size or header) Tighten the time window or event threshold (e.g. only trigger on 5+ failed logins within 60 seconds) In tools like Snort or Suricata, this often means editing rule files directly or writing suppression rules. In commercial tools, it may involve using built-in filters or UI-based rule editors. Layer in contextual detection If your IDS supports it, integrate threat intelligence, geolocation, or asset criticality. For example, you might accept certain traffic from internal dev systems but alert if the same activity comes from a public IP or hits a production database. Test, monitor, and iterate After tuning, test against both real traffic and simulated attacks. Did you eliminate noise without silencing something important? Add logging to track suppression hits over time so you can revisit them if behavior changes. Document everything False positive tuning decisions should be recorded: what was changed, why it was safe, and who approved it. This helps with audits, team transparency, and long-term tuning hygiene. Why interviewers ask this They're testing whether you understand the balance between visibility and signal quality. Anyone can say ""tune the IDS,"" but they're looking for someone who can explain how to do it, why it's necessary, and how not to break detection in the process. So if you can talk through real examples of reducing alert fatigue while preserving coverage, it shows you're ready to own part of the detection engineering pipeline.",0.6096608638763428,0.0007304740277317997,-0.07200689613819122,0.17904761904761907,0.05353728489483747,0.09523809523809525
