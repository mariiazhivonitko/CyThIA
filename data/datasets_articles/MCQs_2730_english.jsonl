{"question": "Question: SCENARIO\n\nLooking back at your first two years as the Director of Personal  Information Protection and Compliance for the Berry Country Regional Medical  Center in Thorn Bay, Ontario, Canada, you see a parade of accomplishments,  from developing state-of-the-art simulation based training for employees on  privacy protection to establishing an interactive medical records system that  is accessible by patients as well as by the medical personnel. Now, however,  a question you have put off looms large: how do we manage all the data-not  only records produced recently, but those still on hand from years ago? A  data flow diagram generated last year shows multiple servers, databases, and  work stations, many of which hold files that have not yet been incorporated  into the new records system.\nWhile most of this data is encrypted, its persistence may pose security and  compliance concerns. The situation is further complicated by several  long-term studies being conducted by the medical staff using patient  information. Having recently reviewed the major Canadian privacy regulations,  you want to make certain that the medical center is observing them.\n\nYou also recall a recent visit to the Records Storage Section, often termed  \"The Dungeon\" in the basement of the old hospital next to the  modern facility, where you noticed a multitude of paper records. Some of  these were in crates marked by years, medical condition or alphabetically by  patient name, while others were in undifferentiated bundles on shelves and on  the floor. The back shelves of the section housed data tapes and old hard  drives that were often unlabeled but appeared to be years old. On your way  out of the dungeon, you noticed just ahead of you a small man in a lab coat  who you did not recognize. He carried a batch of folders under his arm,  apparently records he had removed from storage.\n\nWhich regulation most likely applies to the data stored by Berry Country  Regional Medical Center?\n=======", "answers": ["Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act", "Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act", "The Health Records Act 2001", "The European Union Directive 95/46/EC"], "label": "A", "language": "English", "ability": "逻辑推理", "domain": "安全标准与法规"}
