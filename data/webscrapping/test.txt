Two-factor authentication enhances security by necessitating users to furnish two distinct forms of verification, typically a password and a temporary code, thereby bolstering protection. -It's important because even if a password is compromised, unauthorized access is prevented without the second factor.
Vulnerabilities often arise from misconfigured services, default settings that are never updated, bugs in the server's operating system, and outdated web server software. These flaws can expose the system to exploits ranging from remote code execution to privilege escalation. Security professionals must be adept at hardening web servers by changing default ports, disabling unnecessary services, updating software regularly, enforcing secure permissions, and monitoring log files for suspicious activities. These actions can greatly reduce the attack surface and improve the system's overall security posture.
TCP uses a three-way handshake to establish reliable connections. The connection is full-duplex, with synchronization (SYN) and acknowledgment (ACK) on both sides. The exchange of these four flags is done in three steps: SYN, SYN to ACK, and ACK.
