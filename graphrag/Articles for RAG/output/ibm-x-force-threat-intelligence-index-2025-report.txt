1The pattern is familiar. Organizations devote 
ever-growing resources to detect threats, protect 
networks, and deter disruption. And despite  
this, cyberattacks continue to grow in scale,  
speed, and sophistication.
But over the past 18-24 months, there has been a 
marked change in tactics. Threat actors are pursuing 
broader-scale campaigns—demonstrating a level of 
coordination, automation, and prowess not seen 
before—and raising the likelihood and impact 
associated with operational risks. Unlike incidents of 
the past, where data breaches and reputational harm 
were the greatest concern, widescale business 
disruption is now a real possibility—something every 
boardroom needs to be aware of and act upon.
A campaign conducted by Salt Typhoon, an advanced 
persistent threat (APT) group, exemplifies this 
troubling trend. In 2024, this threat actor group 
compromised virtually every major US telecommuni -
cations provider—in addition to targets in dozens of 
other countries—impacting supply chains, energy 
infrastructure, transportation, healthcare, and other 
critical services, including breaches of highly 
sensitive government systems.1
As the Salt Typhoon attack demonstrates, threat 
actors are becoming more proficient at hiding illicit 
activity. They are massively increasing their use of 
compromised credentials to log in to networks, 
precluding any need to hack in. And doing so makes 
this activity much harder to detect and isolate. When 
threat actors use public cloud infrastructure, it 
becomes far more difficult for cyberdefenders to 
discern between safe and unsafe workloads.
The new litmus test is how well we can defend against 
resourceful threat actors conducting campaign-ori -
ented, supply chain attacks. While we can use 
standard cyber risk practices to mitigate individual 
threats, what we are seeing is the emergence of a 
categorically different kind of risk—one that seeks to 
exploit our growing reliance on interconnectivity and 
common digital services.Foreword
To see things differently, we ourselves need to 
change. CISOs can play a decisive role in  
advocating change—starting with the C-suite and 
boardroom—but also raising awareness and  
accountability across the organization and in  
collaboration with ecosystem partners.
The growing coordination and complexity of attacks 
points to a need for a multifaceted and multilateral 
response. Awareness and accountability need to 
extend to every partner in our ecosystem—so we are 
standing together. Many sentries make a vital, more 
secure community. This isn’t such a radical notion. In 
fact, it’s exactly what cyber adversaries are doing by 
building crime-as-a-service communities and 
malware marketplaces on the dark web.
When executives understand that “what happens to 
my partners also happens to me,” they can take the 
necessary steps to support greater supply chain and 
ecosystem-level awareness and accountability. 
Coordination is critical to preventing intrusions, 
enabling rapid response, and mitigating the impact  
of attacks. Real-time threat intelligence, advanced 
multilayered defense platforms, zero trust network 
segmentation, and AI-powered monitoring are  
all essential components.
As stewards of trust, we are protecting not only our 
organizations and each other, but the integrity, 
values, and opportunities that bind us.
Since 1993, IBM has gathered, analyzed, and shared 
information and expertise about cyber attackers to 
help organizations navigate the evolving threat 
landscape. The IBM X-Force 2025 Threat Intelligence 
Index focuses on observations from our expert team 
of analysts, researchers, and hackers, tracking how 
threat actors get in, what they do when they’re in, and 
the impact caused by each breach. With these 
insights, we look forward to helping you stay one step 
ahead of cyberthreats, reinforce your organization’s 
operational resilience, and build strong, strategic 
partnerships that create cyber advantage now and 
into the future.Manufacturing is the #1-targeted 
industry, four years in a row.
Manufacturing organizations continued to experience 
significant impacts from attacks, including extortion 
(29%) and data theft (24%), targeting financial assets 
and intellectual property. Defying the declining trend 
in malware, manufacturing had the highest number of 
ransomware cases in 2024 as attackers continue to 
exploit outdated legacy technology in this industry.
Number of infostealers delivered 
via phishing emails per week 
increases by 84%.
Year-over-year, X-Force is seeing a rise in infostealers 
delivered via phishing emails and credential phishing. 
Both result in active credentials that may be used in 
follow-on, identity-based attacks. Phishing has 
emerged as a shadow infection vector for valid 
account compromises. By clicking on links that seem 
legitimate, users can unknowingly open the door to 
infostealer malware that siphons sensitive data from 
victims. Because adversaries hide and deliver 
malware payloads more cleverly, it can take longer to 
detect than ransomware and data breaches.Asia-Pacific region sees a 13% 
increase in attacks.
Asia-Pacific (APAC) experienced the largest share of 
incidents in 2024 (34%). This underscores APAC’s 
growing exposure to cyberthreats, likely due to its 
critical role in global supply chains and its position as 
a technology and manufacturing hub. 
Threat actors add AI  
to their toolboxes.
Our analysts have documented that threat actors are 
using AI to build web sites and incorporate deepfakes 
in phishing attacks. We have also observed threat 
actors applying gen AI to create phishing emails and 
write malicious code.2Key takeaways 
23Identity-based attacks make up 
30% of total intrusions.  
For the second year in a row attackers adopted more 
stealthy and persistent attack methods, with nearly 
one in three attacks that X-Force observed using valid 
accounts. A surge in phishing emails distributing 
infostealer malware and credential phishing fuels this 
trend, which may be attributed to attackers 
leveraging AI to scale attacks.
26% of attacks against  
critical infrastructure exploit 
public-facing applications. 
One in four attacks exploited vulnerabilities in 
common public-facing or internet accessible 
applications. After gaining access, threat actors use 
active scanning techniques post-compromise to 
identify new vulnerabilities, gain additional access, 
and move laterally in compromised environments. 
Most importantly, attackers seek to escalate 
privileges to gain access to core services. The longer 
a threat remains undetected, the greater the risk. 
Long dwell times allow adversaries to mask their 
activity by “living off the land”—stealing data weeks 
or even months after an initial breach.3Ransomware makes up 28% of 
malware cases.
While ransomware made up the largest share of 
malware cases in 2024 at 28%, X-Force observed a 
decline in ransomware incidents overall. This is the 
third year that ransomware incidents have declined. 
This may be part of a larger decline in ransomware 
attacks due to businesses being more reluctant to 
pay ransoms and increased government actions 
against ransomware groups.
4 out of top 10 vulnerabilities  
most mentioned on the dark  
web are linked to sophisticated 
threat actors.
All top 10 vulnerabilities had publicly available exploit 
code or were being exploited in the wild, with 60% of 
these having a public exploit available from less than 
two weeks after disclosure -- including several zero 
day vulnerabilities. This raises the risks for 
businesses as sophisticated threat actors, including 
nation-state actors, leverage dark web anonymity to 
acquire new tools and resources.
4
This year, we’ve seen shape-shifting cyber adversaries gain  
more access, move across networks more easily, and create new 
outposts in relative obscurity. 
Equipped with advanced tools, threat actors are increasingly using compromised 
log-in credentials rather than brute-force hacking. The damage they inflict continues 
to grow as the global average cost of a data breach hit a record $4.88 million in 2024.4 
What’s even more concerning is that data breaches are often only the start of larger 
and more coordinated campaigns. Threat actors openly trade exploits on the dark web 
to target critical infrastructure such as power grids, health networks, and industrial 
systems. Ransomware and infostealer operators exfiltrate millions of credentials 
from enterprises and extort victim organizations in multiple ways. And as businesses 
manage multiple cloud environments and accelerate AI adoption, attack surfaces 
expand and create new gaps in identity that attackers exploit to steal critical data. 
Cybercriminals are increasingly adopting stealthy tactics and prioritizing data theft 
over encryption and exploiting identities at scale. A surge in phishing emails delivering 
infostealer malware and credential phishing are fueling this trend—and may be 
attributed to attackers leveraging AI to scale distribution. 
Generative AI is emerging as a new and growing addition to the toolbox of nation-
state-backed threat actors, cybercriminals, hacktivists, and others. These adversaries 
are avid adopters, especially as they launch social engineering campaigns and 
high-tempo information operations. AI and automated solutions can magnify the 
impact of infostealers, expedite the fabrication of credentials, and make it easier to 
amplify the speed and scale of intrusions at lower cost. Introduction5
Ransomware comprises nearly one-third (28%) of 
malware incident response cases and 11% of security 
cases, representing a decline over the last several 
years. This likely reflects an evolution in defensive 
tactics, such as increased collaboration with law 
enforcement, to take down the infrastructure of 
prominent botnets linked to ransomware attacks.
While the evolved defensive tactics are encouraging, 
ransomware attacks are still a notable threat. In fact, 
analysis of dark web data reveals a 25% increase 
in ransomware activity year-over-year—painting 
a different picture. Adoption of a cross-platform 
approach to ransomware, supporting both 
Windows and Linux, also appears to be the norm 
among ransomware threat groups—expanding 
attack surfaces. Although ransomware is being 
overshadowed by other tactics, it remains a 
major threat vector. The most dangerous trend in 
ransomware is the use of multiple extortion tactics. 
These attacks return dividends many times over.With the increased effectiveness of endpoint 
detection and response (EDR) solutions detecting 
backdoor intrusion efforts via phishing, threat actors 
have shifted to using phishing as a shadow vector to 
deliver infostealer malware. In 2024, we observed an 
84% increase in infostealers delivered via phishing. 
There was also a 12% year-over-year increase of 
infostealer credentials for sale on the dark web, 
suggesting increased usage.
Despite the magnitude of these challenges, we 
found that most organizations still don’t have a cyber 
crisis plan or playbooks for scenarios that require 
swift responses. Quick, decisive action is required 
to counteract the faster pace with which threat 
actors, increasingly aided by AI, can conduct attacks, 
exfiltrate data, and exploit vulnerabilities.6
The intersection of  
AI and cybersecurity
2023 was the “breakout year” for generative AI (or gen AI). And what 
we expected began to take shape—threat actors are using AI to build 
web sites and incorporate deepfakes in phishing attacks. X-Force 
found threat actors applying gen AI to create phishing emails and write 
malicious code.5
However, in terms of attackers building at-scale attacks targeting specific AI 
technologies, last year we predicted that once the technologies establish market 
dominance—when a single technology approaches 50% market share or when the 
market consolidates to three or fewer technologies—attackers will be incentivized 
to invest in attack toolkits targeting AI models and solutions.6 Are we there yet? Not 
quite, but adoption is growing. The percentage of companies integrating AI into at 
least one business function has dramatically increased to 72% in 2024, up 55% from 
the previous year.7 
New technologies, such as gen AI, create new attack surfaces. Security researchers 
are sprinting to find and help fix vulnerabilities before attackers do. We expect 
vulnerabilities in AI frameworks to become more common over time, such as the 
remote code execution vulnerability X-Force found in a framework for building AI 
agents.8 Recently, an active attack campaign targeting a widely used open source 
AI framework was discovered, affecting education, cryptocurrency, biopharma, and 
other sectors.9 Weaknesses in AI technology translate into vulnerabilities for attackers 
to exploit.
Another example of potential attack surfaces exposed in this new landscape 
is through machine learning operations (MLOps) platforms. These are used by 
enterprises of all sizes to develop, train, deploy, and monitor large language models 
(LLMs) and other foundation models (FMs), as well as the gen AI applications  
built on these models.10 
As adoption grows, attacks on AI infrastructure and tools will gain traction. 
Organizations should prepare now for threats by securing the AI pipeline from the 
start, including underlying training data, models, and the broader infrastructure 
surrounding the models. Yet, this doesn’t appear to be the current practice across 
many organizations, with only 24% of generative AI projects secured.11 
67
However, despite the evolving tools and different 
technologies attackers leverage—whether new  
gen AI tools or new AI infrastructure—the  
security fundamentals to thwart these attacks  
remain the same.
Our research shows threat actors are using 
valid credentials to log in; exploit unpatched 
vulnerabilities; and to a slightly lesser extent, 
phish their way in—with or without AI assistance. 
Organizations need to develop and run their own 
cybersecurity playbooks—seeking to identify 
exposures, assess risks, and mitigate incident 
impacts. But playbooks also need to account for 
who is responsible for specific actions, such as 
which party is accountable (and potentially liable) for 
securing a genAI solution offered by a third-party.

“Cybercriminals are most often breaking in without 
breaking anything – capitalizing on identity and  
access management gaps proliferating from complex 
hybrid cloud environments. Compromised credentials 
offer attackers multiple potential entry points with 
effectively no risk.”
Mark Hughes,   
Global Managing Partner for Cybersecurity Services, IBM8Top initial access vectors
The top initial access vector observed in 2024 was a tie  
between exploitation of public facing applications and use of valid  
account credentials, both representing 30% of X-Force incidence 
response engagements.  
 
The abuse of valid account credentials is an area we highlighted last year after 
observing a dramatic rise, continuing the theme of “hackers don’t break in, they log in.” 
This continues to be a problem and an initial access vector that adversaries are  
quick to exploit. 
Threat actors obtain valid credentials to use during attacks via a range of methods. 
Data from our dark web analysis and incident response engagements continue to point 
to infostealer malware as being prevalent across industries. Additionally, credentials 
are still purchased and sold in large quantities on dark web marketplaces.
While multifactor identification (MFA) adoption has grown, we observed attackers 
selling adversary-in-the-middle (AITM) phishing kits and custom AITM attack 
services on the dark web to help bypass typical defensive measures. In 2024, X-Force 
specifically responded to cases involving this technique, globally and cross-industry. 
Widescale availability of credentials on the dark web, along with increased access  
to MFA codes and services to circumvent MFA, suggests a thriving  
access-as-a-service criminal market.   
Phishing, whether through attachment or links, rounded out the top three 
compromises. The share of successful phishing compromises has declined steadily 
over the last several years from 46% in 2022 to 29% in 2023 to now just 25% of 
all incidents remediated by X-Force in 2024. Despite the development of some 
cybercriminals investing in AI to carry out phishing attacks, this method continues 
to be a less successful method for compromising environments than exploiting 
vulnerabilities or using valid credentials.
This is likely because enterprises continue to thwart phishing attempts—regardless 
of whether the phish used AI or not—by adopting and revaluating phishing mitigation 
techniques and strategies.9Exploit public-facing

Compared to previous years, the volume of phishing emails distributing 
persistent backdoor malware has declined significantly. High-volume 
distributors of malware leading to ransomware attacks – including Emotet, 
TrickBot, IdedID, Qakbot, Gozi, and Pikabot – have largely dropped off the 
radar. Deploying persistent malware on an endpoint through an email is 
much more likely to be detected by endpoint detection and response (EDR) 
solutions, forcing threat actors to adapt strategies and focus on identities. 
This manifested in an increase in the use of infostealers and a shift towards 
credential phishing.
Infostealer bot frameworks enable attackers to design infostealer 
behaviors and create server-based management panels where 
infostealers send data. We observed a rise of 84% more infostealers 
delivered on average via phishing emails per week in 2024 versus 2023. 
Early data from 2025 suggests an even greater increase of 180% of weekly 
volume compared to 2023. 
By using infostealers, threat actors can quickly exfiltrate credentials before 
detection without keeping a persistent backdoor as an initial foothold. The 
most common infostealer malware distributed directly via phishing was 
AgentTesla, followed by FormBook, SnakeKeylogger, and PureLogs Stealer.
We also observed an increase in Hive0145 email campaigns distributing 
the Strela Stealer infostealer. Hive0145 is an initial access broker focused 
on targeting victims throughout Europe with Strela Stealer malware.  
This infostealer has been in existence since at least 2022 and has always 
been purely focused on exfiltrating email credentials, leading to business 
email compromise. Since then, Hive0145 has experimented with several 
advanced techniques to improve campaign effectiveness.
Throughout 2024, we recorded a significant increase in volume,  
especially in the second half of the year. As of July 2024, this threat  
actor began using a new technique—dubbed attachment hijacking—to 
weaponize legitimate invoice-related emails which were previously  
stolen to further spread Strela Stealer.13Lumma3,794,600

Analysis of dark web data reveals listings of infostealer advertisements increased 12% in 2024 over the 
previous year. The number one infostealer listing by a wide margin was Lumma, followed by RisePro, Vidar, 
Stealc and RedLine. Each listing can contain hundreds of credentials. Sources: IBM X-Force and Cybersixgill.
11FIGURE 2 
Top five infostealers seen on  
dark web forums12Additional infostealers analyzed in 2024 include well-established names such as 
Lumma, RisePro, Vidar, Stealc, Amadey, AgentTesla, AZORult, LokiBot, DanaBot, 
newer families such as Byakugan, FireStealer, ACR Stealer, DoomStealer, and 
WhiteSnake, and even MacOS targeted stealers such as MetaStealer and CloudChat. 
The second change we observed in 2024 is an increase in credential phishing. 
Malicious URLs redirect victims to fake login sites for popular applications and  
harvest credentials.Both credential phishing and infostealer malware harvest active 
credentials for use in follow-on attacks.. For second-stage attacks, the vector is  
use of valid accounts, one of the most common initial access vectors during the  
last two years. 
However, it is almost impossible to trace back to the origin of the compromised 
credentials. It is likely, that for many valid accounts incidents, the actual infection 
vector was a premeditated credential phishing or infostealer malware campaign, a 
fact that cannot be accurately reflected in the statistic of initial access vectors. 
Although by the numbers it might seem like phishing risks are decreasing, it’s just 
become more challenging to determine where the risk originated. Valid credentials 
still must be sourced from somewhere. While it can be difficult to prove, most 
compromised credentials came from infostealers and credential harvesting 
campaigns, of which an increasing amount is delivered via phishing.
Deploying persistent malware on an endpoint  
through an email is much more likely to be detected  
by EDR solutions, forcing threat actors to adapt  
strategies and focus on identities.  13Infostealers, a persistent and growing threat 
Increasingly, infostealers are 
distributed through techniques such  
as SEO poisoning and Google Ads, 
drive-by attacks, and software supply 
chain compromises.
Once installed, infostealers run in the 
background to take screenshots, 
capture keystrokes, access passwords, 
and compromise financial and personal information without user knowledge. 
They have also been frequently linked 
to more impactful attacks against 
enterprises by allowing attackers to 
gain access through stolen login 
credentials. Infostealers have long 
been a staple of the criminal 
marketplace, and many operate as a 
malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model.Infostealers are malicious software 
programs designed to steal valuable 
information. Attack vectors typically 
include phishing emails, malicious 
websites, or infected software downloads.
1314Cloud-hosted phishing
In one of our most significant findings, our research reveals that over the past year, 
threat actors have shifted to using cloud hosting services to facilitate mass phishing 
campaigns. These campaigns have increased significantly in volume. The abuse of 
cloud hosting services often guarantees attackers a trusted URL, domain, and IP for 
use in their phishing campaigns—at least as long as the cloud hosting service fails  
to detect the abuse and act. For most providers, the sheer mass of abused accounts 
can be overwhelming. Adversaries require payloads to stay up only until victims  
click the link.
Latin America (LATAM) is one of the most severely impacted regions for phishing 
campaigns. Throughout 2024 threat actors have significantly ramped up the volume of 
LATAM-targeted campaigns abusing cloud hosting services.
These landscape changes make it much more difficult for defenders to prevent 
successful phishing attacks. Organizations cannot realistically block PDFs and URLs in 
emails because they are used everywhere across everyday operations. Furthermore, 
organizations cannot block legitimate cloud hosting services. 
The only way to help avoid this is using time-sensitive threat intelligence tools to block 
URLs flagged as malicious and by relying on layered defenses to reduce impact if 
users take the phishing email bait. This means using endpoint detection and response 
(EDR) to detect info-stealing malware and using passkeys and MFA to reduce the risk 
of credential harvesting campaigns. The LATAM region is especially targeted and 
should remain vigilant against phishing campaigns. An effective way to counter the 
scale of these attacks is through the use of AI tools and automation.
What is cloud-hosted malware?
Attackers use malware hosting services  
to house and distribute malware and support  
browser exploits and drive-by downloads to  
infiltrate vulnerable computers.
Cloud-hosted malware attacks have proliferated 
because of increased reliance on cloud services, the 
inherent vulnerabilities of cloud estates, and the ease 
of distribution and persistence enabled by cloud 
infrastructure. Although cloud environments provide security features, they can be exploited when not 
properly configured, when vulnerabilities are not 
patched, or when policies are not updated. Cloud-hosted malware refers to malicious software, 
including worms, trojans, ransomware, or infostealers 
that use cloud services for hosting, distribution and/or 
command and control operations.50,000100,000150,000200,000250,000300,000350,000400,000450,000

mask malicious activity by using popular cloud hosting services. The cloud hosting services secureserver.net 
(purple), publiccloud.com.br belonging to Locaweb Serviços de Internet (blue) and Microsoft Azure Blob 
Storage (white) have been abused heavily as a means to distribute credential phishing sites and banking trojan 
malware such as Grandoreiro, Mekotio and Guildma. NOTE: The use of a specific cloud provider for hosting 
malicious content is not indicative of a security flaw in the platform but illustrates where attackers choose to 
stage malware. Often, attackers choose well-known and established providers as a way to fool victims by 
hiding nefarious activities amongst other legitimate workloads, making those activities harder to identify and 
isolate. Source: IBM X-Force.16Obfuscation is becoming an important tactic and PDF 
malware disguises malicious URLs by encrypting them, 
hiding them in compressed streams, or using hexadecimal 
representations to hinder automated analysis.PDFs and URLs taking over malware spam 
In 2024, we observed a clear decrease in direct malware attachments such as ZIP 
archives or maldocs in phishing emails. Malicious ZIP and RAR attachments dropped 
by 70% and 45% respectively, with a similar drop observed for Excel and Word 
documents.14 Malware is increasingly distributed via malicious URLs, both directly in 
phishing emails and through PDF attachments. This may be a result of better malware 
scanners in email solutions, which have become more accurate at detecting malware, 
but often cannot classify URLs or URLs inside benign attachments as malicious. 
Obfuscation is becoming an important tactic for threat actors, and PDF malware 
disguises malicious URLs by encrypting them, hiding them in compressed streams or 
using hexadecimal representations which can also hinder automated analysis of email 
security solutions. Of all PDFs, 42% used obfuscated URLs, 28% hid their URLs in PDF 
streams, and 7% were delivered in an encrypted form along with a password. 
Several threat actors were observed using PDFs to deliver malware through malicious 
URLs, including Hive0118 and Hive0137. These are ex-ITG23 affiliated distributors, 
which used PDFs with embedded links in several campaigns in the first half of 2024 to 
deliver malware and AITM links.15 These distributors have started experimenting with 
new attachment types such as PDFs with obfuscated URLs, documents with 
embedded URLs and others to load a wide arsenal of malware including Pikabot, 
DarkGate, NetSupport, T34-Loader and Warmcookie. 
In 2024, PDF files were also commonly used in LATAM-targeted phishing campaigns 
to deliver links leading to banking trojan malware.17

171830% of the incidents X-Force responded to in 2024 involved the exploitation of  
public-facing applications. For many organizations, this is magnified by vulnerability 
patch management challenges. Furthermore, in 25% of these cases, we observed 
active scanning post-compromise—meaning attackers used vulnerability scanning 
tools to identify additional vulnerabilities, gain additional access, and move laterally  
in the compromised environment.
Threat actors exploit known vulnerabilities in common applications and infrastructure 
services and the attack vector is simply a matter of acting on this knowledge. Bots and 
automation tools acquired on the dark web can target an organization’s key 
infrastructure applications and services.
Unfortunately for cyber defenders, there is no shortage of vulnerabilities to exploit. 
Since 1993, we have categorized over 300,000 unique vulnerabilities. Included are 
nearly 65,000 vulnerabilities with a publicly available exploit, many of which  
attackers have used to compromise environments. In other words, nearly a quarter  
of all vulnerabilities have an associated weaponized exploit that can be leveraged  
by threat actors.
Also, of note, the number of vulnerabilities has increased rapidly over the past eight 
years and grown threefold. This could be attributed to many factors. Perhaps the most 
likely is a growing reliance on shared cloud infrastructure and services. Attacking 
common cloud infrastructure is a prized opportunity for threat actors to deploy 
malware at scale and expand their potential for disruption. This is another compelling 
reason why zero trust principles, such as network segmentation, are essential for 
cyberdefenders. By isolating workloads, we limit the potential blast radius of attacks.
18The success of 
vulnerability 
exploitation 
What are common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs), weaponized exploits, and zero days?  
The CVE system provides a unique way to identify publicly 
known cybersecurity vulnerabilities and exposures 
occurring in software, hardware, and other digital systems.
It allows organizations to track security issues 
effectively and share knowledge, enabling security 
teams to refer to the same vulnerability in a 
consistent manner, even across different systems.
MITRE Corporation maintains a publicly listed catalog 
of CVEs, and the CVE list feeds the US National 
Vulnerability Database (NVD) which quickly enriches 
each CVE once it has been published.
In addition to pooling intelligence about common 
vulnerabilities and threat vectors, organizations also 
benefit from sector and industry-specific resources such as information sharing and analysis centers 
(ISACs). Typically managed by non-profit 
organizations, ISACs help critical infrastructure 
operators protect facilities, employees, and 
customers from cyber and physical security threats.
Weaponized exploits, often involving  
malicious payloads or malware, are attack tools  
used by threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities and  
target specific systems.19

1920In collaboration with Cybersixgill, X-Force has reviewed the 10 most 
mentioned common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) on the dark  
web. These include mentions from numerous dark web marketplaces. 
According to our research, out of hundreds of vulnerabilities, the top  
three mentioned CVEs in 2024 were:
1
CVE-2024-21762 (27%)—Fortinet FortiOS could allow a remote attacker 
to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an out-of-bounds write 
flaw in a secure sockets layer virtual private network (SSNVPN). By 
sending specially crafted HTTP requests, an attacker could exploit this 
vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or commands on the system.
2
CVE-2024-3400 (14%)— Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS could allow a  
remote attacker to execute arbitrary command on the system, caused by a 
command injection vulnerability in the GlobalProtect feature. An attacker 
could exploit this vulnerability to inject and execute arbitrary code on  
the system with root privileges. 
3
CVE-2024-23113 (11%)—Fortinet FortiOS could allow remote attackers  
to execute arbitrary code on systems, by using an externally controlled 
format string in the fgfmd daemon. By sending specially crafted  
requests, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary 
code or commands.Vulnerabilities

2122All top 10 vulnerabilities had publicly available exploit code or were found 
being actively exploited in the wild last year. 60% of these vulnerabilities 
had a public exploit available less than two weeks after disclosure— 
including several zero day vulnerabilities. Remote code execution is 
possible with eight of these vulnerabilities. The remaining two allow for an 
attacker to obtain sensitive information. 
Apart from CVE-2024-9680, a remote code execution vulnerability 
affecting Mozilla Firefox, all top 10 CVEs were disclosed in the first half  
of 2024. And readers should understand that the disclosure date of a 
vulnerability plays a factor in terms of placement in the top 10, as earlier 
disclosure means more time for dark web discussions. The fact that these 
specific vulnerabilities have been discussed most suggests a strong 
interest by threat actors in exploiting them. Given that many other 
vulnerabilities discussed and disclosed earlier in the year didn’t make  
the top 10, we think there’s more to these vulnerabilities that makes  
them worthy of further attention.
Several of these CVEs have been linked to sophisticated threat  
actor groups, including nation-state actors:
CVE-2024-24919
A vulnerability in Check Point Security Gateway could 
allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive 
information. This issue has been linked to several APT 
groups, including UNC2452, APT29, Royal, BITWISE 
SPIDER, and Akira.16
CVE-2024-23897
A vulnerability in Jenkins weekly and Jenkins LTS 
could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive 
information. The threat actor, Intelbroker, leveraged 
this vulnerability to conduct a supply chain attack.18CVE-2024-3400
A zero-day vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks 
PAN-OS could allow a remote attacker to execute 
arbitrary commands on vulnerable system. UTA0218, 
potentially a China-based threat actor, was observed 
exploiting this vulnerability.17
CVE-2024-9680
A vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox could allow a remote 
attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable 
system. The Russia-aligned APT group known as 
RomCom was observed exploiting this vulnerability. 23Four of the top 10 vulnerabilities impacting networking appliances include 
Fortinet FortiOS (CVE-2024-21762, CVE-2024-23113), Check Point 
Security Gateway (CVE-2024-24919) and Ivanti Connect Secure and Ivanti 
Policy Secure Gateways (CVE-2024-21887).•In February 2024, the 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released an 
advisory about Volt Typhoon, a China-based APT actor that has 
compromised the IT environments of multiple US-based critical 
infrastructure organizations. The advisory notes this APT is gathering 
intelligence about US critical infrastructure and pre-positioning 
themselves to enable lateral movement to OT (Operational Technology) 
assets to disrupt functions in communications, energy, transportation 
systems, water and wastewater systems. CISA further notes this APT 
actor typically gains initial access by exploiting vulnerabilities in public-
facing network appliances.
Knowing the most discussed CVEs on the dark web can inform defenders 
on which vulnerabilities require prioritized patching. In addition, threat 
intelligence teams should actively search the dark web for sensitive code 
that has been exfiltrated, which less sophisticated threat groups can 
quickly weaponize to target those organizations.

hacking into a subscription service available to threat 
actors worldwide.Cybercrime marketplaces
The dark web is a cloistered area of the 
internet that can only be reached by 
using specialized software that allows 
users to visit websites anonymously. 
Although it can be used legitimately by 
journalists, whistleblowers, and 
researchers to communicate without 
being tracked, the dark web is also 
commonly used by criminals involved 
with drugs and arms trafficking, stolen 
data, and other illegal activities. This is  
the marketplace where threat actors 
buy and sell cybercrime as a  
service (CaaS) software.Mimicking software-as-a-service 
business models, CaaS transforms 
hacking into a subscription service 
available to threat actors around the 
world. CaaS provides hacking tools for 
criminals to launch distributed denial of 
service (DDoS) phishing, malware, 
spyware, credential stuffing, and an 
ever-expanding range of other 
cybercrime attacks and activities.20The dark web and  
cybercrime-as-a-service26Securing enterprise Linux environments is critical because they host 
essential applications, databases, and services. Linux use cases  
include web server, application development, cloud container,  
and virtualization frameworks.
In collaboration with Red Hat Insights, X-Force found that 95% of Red Hat 
Enterprise Linux customers were vulnerable to at least one CVE with a 
publicly available exploit. Additionally, 65% had at least three CVEs with 
known exploits. While this data is representative of Red Hat Enterprise 
Linux environments, it provides an indication of what many organizations 
are likely facing in terms of exposure to vulnerability exploitation. 
Furthermore, more than half of Red Hat Enterprise Linux customers’ 
environments had at least one critical CVE unaddressed. Even more 
concerning, 18% of organizations faced five or more vulnerabilities, 
meaning that nearly one in five organizations are operating with  
five or more CVEs.Red Hat

2829Top actions on objectives
Actions on objectives are steps or activities taken to achieve a  
defined objective or goal. In a cybersecurity context, these  
measurable and actionable steps are part of a larger plan directly 
linked to threat actor objectives.
According to X-Force incident response data, the deployment of malware was the most 
observed action on objectives, making up 42% of cases, just slightly less than the prior 
year. Of all the malware cases, 28% involved ransomware, followed by backdoors and 
webshells, at 20% and 13% respectively.
“Businesses need to shift away from an ad-hoc prevention 
mindset and focus on proactive measures such as 
modernizing authentication management, plugging 
multi-factor authentication holes and conducting  
real-time threat hunting to uncover hidden threats before 
they expose sensitive data.”

A ransomware event on the dark web is defined as a claim made by a threat actor group that an organization 
has been impacted by ransomware.”Sources: IBM X-Force and Cybersixgill.
3233The impact of takedowns on the malware landscape
In August 2023, a multinational takedown operation significantly disrupted the 
Qakbot botnet linked to follow-on ransomware attacks from groups such as Black 
Basta, Conti, and REvil.21 Qakbot briefly returned in December 2023, but their 
recovery was short-lived, and the malware disappeared again in January 2024.
In May 2024, a Europol-led coalition of international law enforcement agencies 
formed the “Operation Endgame” task force to identify, investigate, and take down 
prominent cybercrime groups. On May 30, 2024, Operation Endgame announced 
that they had taken down networks and infrastructure relating to IcedID, SystemBC, 
Pikabot, Pikabot, Bumblebee, and TrickBot.22 The takedown included over 100 servers 
and 2,000 domains linked to malicious activity, as well as arrests and asset seizures. 
As a result of these takedowns, we have seen increased diversification 
and turnover in the malware activity of actors associated with cybercrime 
groups such as ITG23, (Wizard Spider, TrickBot Group), ITG25 (Lunar Spider, 
IcedID), and ITG26 (Qakbot, Pikabot). Previously well-established malware 
families linked to these groups are no longer operational and we have seen 
threat actors turn to other malware, including new and short-lived families, 
as cybercrime groups attempt to replace botnets that were taken down.Ransomware landscape
Our review of data from the dark web—combined with telemetry data, incident 
response case documentation, and malware analysis—suggests that Akira, 
LockBit, Black Basta, RansomHub, and Hunters International were among the 
most active ransomware families over the past year. In 2024, the most discussed 
ransomware events were associated with CLOP, followed by LockBit 3.0 and 
RansomHub (see Figure 11). A ransomware event on the dark web is when a 
threat actor group claims an organization has been impacted by ransomware.
For the past several years, we have reported that ransomware groups were 
increasingly creating Linux versions of their ransomware exploits in addition 
to targeting Windows environments. This now appears to be the norm, with 
all ransomware groups listed above adopting a cross-platform approach and 
supporting both Windows and Linux, and occasionally additional platforms 
such as ESXi hypervisors and FreeBSD. There are also reports of ransomware 
groups increasingly using the bring-your-own-vulnerable-driver (BYOVD) 
technique to escalate privileges and terminate processes such as EDR.
However, despite the larger share of ransomware cases relative to 
other types of malware, and a 25% increase in ransomware events 
on the dark web, we have observed an overall decline in ransomware 
incident response engagements for a third year in a row.
This could be attributed to several factors. One reason for this decline 
is that high-volume distributors of malware—which often precipitate 
ransomware attacks—have been on the decline. Another reason is that 
over the past few years international law enforcement agencies have been 
increasingly collaborating to take down the infrastructure of prominent 
botnets which have often been the gateway to ransomware attacks. 34Malware crypters
Crypter software is used by cybercriminals to disguise malware so it can 
slip through security programs. X-Force tracks many malware crypters 
linked to ITG23-affiliated actors, which provide insights into the malware 
used by these groups and their relationships with other actors.24
Over the past year we have observed these crypters—which were historically  
and predominantly used to deploy malware such as Qakbot, IcedID, TrickBot, 
Bumblebee, and Pikabot—used with an increasingly diverse range of payloads.  
These include backdoors such as Broomstick (aka Oyster), IceNova (aka Latrodectus), 
DarkGate, Brute Ratel, Cobalt Strike, WarmCookie, and SSLoad, infostealers such 
as ACR Stealer, LummaC2, Rhadamanthys, Stealc, RisePro, DoomStealer, and 
FireStealer, and ransomware including Black Basta, BlackSuit, INC, and Rhysida.
SystemBC is a well-known proxy malware which has been in use since 2018 and 
is often used by ransomware groups such as BlackBasta, LockBit, and Rhysida. 
However, we have also seen several new families over the past couple of years, 
suggesting that this type of malware may be increasing in popularity. These include: 
GhostSocks , a Golang-based proxy malware, advertised on 
Russian underground forums since the end of 2023.
PortStarter , a Golang-based proxy malware, predominantly used by VanillaTempest, 
a group known for deploying ransomware such as Rhysida and INC.
Supper , a proxy malware/backdoor written in C++, linked to the Vanilla Tempest 
group and also reportedly observed in an Interlock ransomware incident.PikaBot, considered to be Qakbot’s replacement, has not been observed 
since Operation Endgame, and Bumblebee took several months to recover, 
only returning in October 2024. The IcedID malware also appears to have 
been retired and replaced by IceNova (aka Latrodectus), which managed to 
make it through the takedowns relatively unscathed, with activity picking 
back up in June 2024 and continuing throughout the rest of the year.23
Crypter software is used by cybercriminals to disguise 
malware so it can slip through security programs.35
Proxy malware and obfuscation tactics
“We have observed an increase in proxy malware, which is 
malware with the ability to operate as a Socks5 proxy and 
forward requests between a C2 (Command and Control) 
server and target systems.”
Threat actors may install proxy malware to act as a 
backdoor to a target network, disguise network 
traffic,or act as part of a proxy service botnet.25
Threat actors’ ability to obfuscate—or operate in the 
shadows—is the real danger. Increasing use of 
obfuscation tactics is a consequence of threat actors’ 
desire to leverage widely available cloud 
35infrastructure and services, and complicate 
mitigation efforts by making workload inspection  
and validation activities more costly and 
expertise-intensive.36Malware payloads delivered via 
SEO poisoning and malvertising
A common infection vector used by threat actors 
is to hide malware within fake or trojanized 
installers of legitimate applications. Users are then 
tricked into downloading and running malicious 
installers via techniques such as phishing, SEO 
poisoning, and malvertising. SEO poisoning uses 
search algorithms to promote malicious web 
pages, and malvertising directs users to bogus 
websites where their data can be stolen. 
These tactics play a significant part in the chain 
of compromise by spoofing legitimate websites, 
thereby obtaining valid credentials that enable 
simple log in (i.e. avoiding the need to hack in).
In early 2024, we observed Hive0133, an initial 
access broker and email distributor that overlaps 
with the group TA544, delivering PDFs containing 
malicious links which led to the download of ZIP files, 
hosted on Discord, containing trojanized versions of 
the Notepad++ application. One of the application’s 
dynamic link libraries (DLLs) was replaced with a 
malicious version containing the WailingCrab malware 
which would be executed via DLL sideloading upon 
execution of the legitimate Notepad++ executable.  
In mid-2024 we observed Hive0118—an initial access 
broker and email spammer known for delivering 
Qakbot and Pikabot malware—use trojanized 
MSIX and APPX installers of popular applications 
such as Google Chrome, AnyDesk, and Microsoft 
Teams to deliver FakeBat downloader scripts. 
We have also observed similar techniques from Latin 
America-based threat actor groups. Throughout 
2024, X-Force observed the Byakugan infostealer 
being distributed to users throughout Latin America, 
specifically Brazil, with Portuguese-language 
phishing emails. The phishing emails encouraged 
users to download a fake Adobe Reader installer 
which would then install the Byakugan malware.Since June 2023, and throughout the first half 
of 2024, there were several prominent Nitrogen 
malvertising campaigns, which impersonated 
legitimate websites for popular tools such as Putty, 
FileZilla, and AdvancedIPScanner, and leveraged 
Google and Bing pay-per-click (PPC) advertisements 
to trick victims into downloading malicious installer 
files. This led to the installation of malware such 
as Cobalt Strike and BlackCat ransomware.
In one incident, a Google search resulted in 
a user downloading a trojanized version of 
the Angry IP Scanner tool, which led to the 
installation of SharpRhino malware, linked to the 
Hunters International ransomware group.37
Credentials are valuable because they open the door to 
additional access vectors and offer attackers additional 
options such as extortion, data theft and data leak.
3738Top impacts on victim organizations
In 2024, the top impact experienced by victim organizations was 
credential harvesting, occurring in 29% of incidents.  
Credentials are valuable because they open the door to additional access vectors and 
offer attackers additional options such as extortion, data theft and data leak. Often, 
attackers leverage stolen credentials to burrow inside a victim environment, making 
detection and remediation more difficult. 
Data theft was the second most observed impact and was seen in 18% of 
incidents. In fact, credentials or data were stolen in nearly half of all cyberattacks, 
highlighting a growing challenge in securing both data and identities. 
The theft of data is often, but not always, accompanied by a subsequent ransom 
demand. Extortion following a ransom demand occurred in 13% of cases, taking the 
fourth spot. Threat actors extort victims in many ways. Traditionally, ransomware 
has been used to encrypt systems and urge victims to pay for decryption keys. More 
recently, however, threat actors have extorted victims without using ransomware. In 
these cases, stolen data is often used to pressure victims into paying for retrieval.39

4445Industry trends
An analysis of X-Force incident response engagements highlights the 
industries most impacted by cyberattacks in 2024. 
Manufacturing retained its position as the most targeted sector, representing 26% 
of incidents, emphasizing its critical role in global supply chains and the value of 
industrial-sector intellectual property. Finance and insurance followed as the second 
most attacked industry, accounting for 23%, reflecting the sector’s sensitivity to data 
breaches and ransomware campaigns.
Of particular interest to governments and utilities, 70% of attacks in 2024 involved 
critical infrastructure. In this subset, the use of valid accounts made up 31% of initial 
access vectors, followed by phishing and exploiting public facing applications, both 
at 26%. Malware was deployed in 40% of cases and ransomware was the malware of 
choice, occurring in 30% of malware deployments. 
The use of legitimate tools was observed in 38% of attacks against critical 
infrastructure organizations while server access was the objective in 12% of incidents. 
Credential harvesting, data theft, and extortion were the top three impacts felt by 
victims in this category, accounting for 27%, 23%, and 20% respectively.
The professional, business, and consumer services sector emerges as another 
significant target, accounting for 18% of incidents.This reflects risks tied to  
third-party providers, supply chain operations, and organizations with  
consumer-facing vulnerabilities.
The energy sector placed fourth at 10%, as attackers continued to exploit its 
operational dependencies and critical infrastructure.
This distribution of incidents highlights a clear pattern of attackers prioritizing sectors 
with high-value assets, operational dependencies, and opportunities for financial or 
geopolitical leverage. To counter these evolving threats, organizations should adopt 
industry-specific risk assessments, prioritize enhanced cybersecurity investments, and 
foster collaborative defense strategies, such as industry or sector-specific ISACs, to 
safeguard these critical sectors and help ensure long-term resilience.4626%

Limit your exposure across  
the threat environment.01 02Action guide
Embed and extend advanced 
security across all AI workloads 
and services.Threat management is the core of every successful cybersecurity program. Cyber risk 
and resilience practices go a long way towards improving security postures. For 
threats that do materialize, we need to evolve from ad hoc risk remediation and threat 
management to proactive, community-based measures such as threat intelligence 
sharing. Working together increases awareness and accountability across supply 
chains and ecosystems and raises collective resilience across the operations lifecycle.
56
Know what the bad guys know about you. Monitor 
the dark web to gather real-world threat intelligence 
about your organization, employees, networks, and 
data on the dark web, before threat actors do.
Keep your employees current on the most effective 
security practices.  Educate your employees  
about the risks associated with phishing attacks  
and poor password hygiene and regularly update  
your people about ways to protect themselves  
and your organization.
Enhance ecosystem-wide incident response 
planning. Work with stakeholders in your 
organization and with partners across your 
ecosystem to develop and regularly update incident 
response plans that specifically address threats 
specific to your industry.Secure your AI development and deployment 
pipeline. Secure each stage of the AI pipeline 
including the data used to train, test, and  
tune models; the AI models themselves; and  
the responsible use of AI models to support robust 
infrastructure security. 
Extend AI governance and ethics accountability. 
Robust governance is essential for trustworthy AI. 
Work with partners to set clear guidelines for AI 
usage; regularly audit AI systems for fairness, bias, 
and drift; and help ensure that AI outputs align with 
broader organizational values and ethics.
Use security frameworks to instill trust in AI 
systems.  Use standardized frameworks that offer 
structured approaches to securing AI systems.  
These cover essential aspects such as data privacy, 
model integrity, usage controls, and ongoing 
monitoring. Protect credentials by reining in data  
and identity sprawl.57

Patch authentication gaps  
before attackers can sneak in.Protect credentials by reining  
in data and identity sprawl.  
57
Implement robust data protection. Protect sensitive 
data wherever it resides, whether in on-premises, in 
the cloud, or in hybrid environments. To protect data 
in motion use encryption, implement strong access 
controls, and monitor data transfers.
Consolidate identity solutions. Work toward 
eliminating disconnected data and identity silos.  
This involves weaving identity management systems 
together into a unified, holistic framework—often 
referred to as an “identity fabric” approach. 
Turn the tables on adversaries with  
AI-powered, proactive threat detection.  As threat 
actors step up the use of AI to develop and scale 
credential-based attacks, step up the use AI and 
machine learning to detect threats faster and respond 
to attacks more effectively.Significantly expand MFA use.  Prioritize  
Multifactor Authentication (MFA) for all employees  
 This provides an extra layer of protection  
for applications and network services, even if 
passwords are compromised.
Modernize identity strategy.  Along with expanded 
MFA usage, develop and implement a comprehensive, 
adaptive, and scalable identity strategy. Align the 
strategy to changing operational and security 
requirements and improve it through regular audits. 
Reduce IT and IS complexity. Growing IT and IS 
complexity hinders the effective administration of 
secure identities and slows down response to 
legitimate threats. To counteract complexity, invest in 
tools and technologies, such as identity fabrics, for 
simpler and more cohesive identity platforms.58Michelle Alvarez
