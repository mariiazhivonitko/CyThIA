Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\r\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\r\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\r\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\r\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\r\n \r\n2.
