Continuous auditing and attestation mechanisms verify that the code running on each node matches an approved, tamper-free version. In parallel, robust anomaly detection flags any outlier updates that deviate suspiciously from expected patterns, indicating a potential poisoning attempt. This layered strategy ensures that decentralized collaboration remains resilient, even if a subset of nodes becomes compromised or behaves maliciously.

Entities communicating via symmetric encryption must exchange the key so they can be used in the decryption process. On the other hand, Asymmetric encryption uses two keys, one public and one private, to encrypt and decrypt messages. While the symmetric encryption is faster, the key needs to be transferred using an unencrypted channel, the asymmetric encryption is slower but more secure. Each has its pros and cons, which means a better approach is to combine the two types of encryption. This means we'll need to set up a channel with asymmetric encryption and send the data using a symmetric process."}

{"question": "What specific security controls might you implement to protect an AI model's hyperparameters from unauthorized tampering?", "answer": "One critical safeguard is restricting access to the configuration files or scripts defining hyperparameters through role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication. Cryptographically, signing hyperparameter files helps ensure their integrity, so any unauthorized alterations trigger an alarm. Creating a robust logging and monitoring infrastructure also flags real-time suspicious changes. Versioning each hyperparameter set and checksums further strengthens security by making unauthorized modifications immediately visible. In high-stakes environments, integrating hardware security modules (HSMs) or employing secure enclaves to manage sensitive data adds an extra safeguard for preserving the integrity of hyperparameters."}

I also seed the generators with multiple entropy sources—like network interrupts or system timers—to reduce predictability. Frequent entropy health checks and logging of random seed states (encrypted) help confirm that the RNG remains robust, especially in environments where large-scale AI computations might deplete available entropy."}
