These actions can greatly reduce the attack surface and improve the system's overall security posture."}
{"question": "What are Polymorphic viruses?", "answer": "\"Poly\" refers to many and \"morphic\" refers to the shape. Thus, polymorphic viruses, as the name suggests, are complex computer viruses that change shape as they spread in order to avoid detection by antivirus programs. This is a self-encrypting virus that combines a mutation engine with a self-propagating code. A polymorphic virus consists of: -Encrypted virus body mutation engine that generates random decryption routines. -A polymorphic virus has its mutation engine and virus body encrypted. When an infected program is run, a virus decryption routine takes control of the computer and decrypts the virus body and mutation engine. -Control is then passed to the virus to detect new programs to infect. Since the body of the virus is encrypted and the decryption routine varies from infection to infection, virus scanners cannot look for a fixed signature or fixed decryption routine, making detection more difficult."}

{"question": "How does a firewall work?", "answer": "A firewall acts like a security guard between your internal network and the outside world. It watches traffic coming in and out, and blocks anything that doesn't follow the rules. For example Those rules might say \"only allow traffic on port 443 from trusted IPs\" or \"block anything trying to access this database.\" Firewalls make these decisions based on things like IP address, port number, protocol, or in more advanced cases, even the contents of the data itself. There are two common types: Network firewalls sit between your internal network and the internet. They filter traffic going in and out of the whole environment Host-based firewalls run on individual machines and filter traffic specific to that device Some firewalls are stateless, meaning they treat every packet in isolation. Others are stateful, meaning they keep track of active connections and can make decisions based on the overall flow of traffic, not just one packet at a time. Why interviewers ask this They want to see if you actually understand how traffic control works in a real environment, and firewalls are one of the most common security tools you'll run into."}

{"question": "Could you share when you had to balance performance optimization and security fortification for an AI model, and what trade-offs did you make?", "answer": "In a global financial analytics project, we aimed to deliver near-instant loan approval predictions to improve user experience. However, the tight latency requirements clashed with our need for robust encryption and real-time anomaly detection. To strike a balance, we opted for a lightweight encryption protocol that still provided sufficient protection but minimized the overhead on inference speed. Additionally, we configured the anomaly detection to run in parallel on a separate microservice so it wouldn't bottleneck the main prediction pipeline. While this approach marginally increased operational costs and required extra architecture considerations, it preserved the model's quick response time. Consequently, we sacrificed a small degree of cryptographic depth for better performance but maintained an adequate security threshold, preventing unscrupulous data tampering or unauthorized access in a high-speed environment.

{"question": "What is multi-factor authentication and why is it important?", "answer": "Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a way of making sure someone really is who they say they are by requiring more than just a password. Instead of relying on a single form of authentication, MFA adds one or more additional layers that fall into different categories: Something you know like a password or a PIN Something you have like a phone, hardware token, or authentication app Something you are like a fingerprint, face scan, or other biometric For example To log in with MFA, a user might enter their password on a website (something they know) and then login to their phone with the face (something they are), so that they can approve a push notification on their phone (something they have). This drastically reduces the chances of an attacker getting in because even if they've stolen the password, they would still need access to the second factor. This matters because most breaches start with stolen or reused credentials. MFA doesn't make systems unbreakable, but it raises the bar enough that many attackers will move on to easier targets. Why interviewers ask this They're testing whether you understand real-world access control, not just theory. MFA is one of the simplest and most effective ways to reduce unauthorized access, and it's used everywhere from cloud platforms to VPNs to email. If you can explain how it works, why it matters, and how it fits into layered security, you're showing that you understand both the technical side and the practical impact."}

{"question": "What is MAC spoofing?", "answer": "MAC stands for Media Access Control. A MAC Address is a physical and unique identification number that's placed on every network-connected device. The MAC address is virtually etched to the hardware by the device manufacturer, which means users cannot change or rewrite the MAC address. However, it's possible to mask the address on the software side. This masking is called MAC spoofing. Hackers use MAC spoofing to hide their identity and imitate others. In network terminology, spoofing is manipulating or infiltrating the address system in computer networks. Other targets that hackers can spoof or manipulate are internet protocol (IP), address resolution protocol (ARP), and the domain name system (DNS)."}

{"question": "What do you mean by Perfect Forward Secrecy?", "answer": "Perfect Forward Secrecy is a style of encryption that creates a temporary exchange of secret keys between the server and client. It is primarily used to call apps, websites, and messaging apps where user privacy is paramount. A new session key is generated each time the user performs an action. This keeps your data uncompromised and safe from attackers. This is separate from special keys. The basic idea behind Perfect Forward Secrecy technology is to generate a new encryption key each time a user initiates a session. So, if only the encryption key is compromised, the conversation is leaked, and if the user's unique key is compromised, the conversation will continue. Encryption keys generated by Perfect Forward Secrecy keep you safe from attackers. Essentially, it provides double protection from attackers."}

{"question": "What's the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?", "answer": "Encryption is how we keep data private, whether it's being stored or sent across a network. The key difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption comes down to how the keys work. Symmetric encryption uses the same key to both encrypt and decrypt data. That means both the sender and the receiver need to have access to the same secret key. It's fast and efficient, which makes it a good choice for encrypting large amounts of data such as entire hard drives or internal backups. The downside is key management in that if someone intercepts the key, they can decrypt everything Asymmetric encryption uses two keys: a public key and a private key. The public key encrypts the data, and only the private key can decrypt it. This is useful when two parties don't already share a key. It's slower than symmetric encryption but essential for things like HTTPS, email encryption (like PGP), and digital signatures. RSA and ECC are common examples Most modern systems use a mix of both. For example When you connect to a secure website, asymmetric encryption is used during the initial handshake to exchange a shared key, but after that, symmetric encryption is used for the rest of the session because it's faster.Why interviewers ask this Encryption is used constantly in real-world systems and you'll see both symmetric and asymmetric methods in play. If you can explain how they differ, when to use them, and what tradeoffs they involve, it shows you're ready to talk about security architecture in a meaningful way."}
