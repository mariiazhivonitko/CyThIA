In parallel, robust anomaly detection flags any outlier updates that deviate suspiciously from expected patterns, indicating a potential poisoning attempt.

A strong approach might include AES-256 with robust key management for data at rest, ensuring keys are rotated regularly and stored securely—data in transit benefits from TLS 1.2 or higher, coupled with certificate pinning for critical endpoints. I also validate encryption strategies through regular penetration testing and audits while maintaining the necessary performance by leveraging hardware acceleration where possible. This end-to-end encryption framework guarantees that each segment of the AI pipeline remains secure against unauthorized interception or compromise. Related: AI Marketing Interview Questions"}]}
