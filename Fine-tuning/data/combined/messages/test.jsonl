A polymorphic virus consists of: -Encrypted virus body mutation engine that generates random decryption routines. -A polymorphic virus has its mutation engine and virus body encrypted. When an infected program is run, a virus decryption routine takes control of the computer and decrypts the virus body and mutation engine. -Control is then passed to the virus to detect new programs to infect. Since the body of the virus is encrypted and the decryption routine varies from infection to infection, virus scanners cannot look for a fixed signature or fixed decryption routine, making detection more difficult."}]}

There are two common types: Network firewalls sit between your internal network and the internet. They filter traffic going in and out of the whole environment Host-based firewalls run on individual machines and filter traffic specific to that device Some firewalls are stateless, meaning they treat every packet in isolation. Others are stateful, meaning they keep track of active connections and can make decisions based on the overall flow of traffic, not just one packet at a time. Why interviewers ask this They want to see if you actually understand how traffic control works in a real environment, and firewalls are one of the most common security tools you'll run into."}]}

However, the tight latency requirements clashed with our need for robust encryption and real-time anomaly detection. To strike a balance, we opted for a lightweight encryption protocol that still provided sufficient protection but minimized the overhead on inference speed. Additionally, we configured the anomaly detection to run in parallel on a separate microservice so it wouldn't bottleneck the main prediction pipeline. While this approach marginally increased operational costs and required extra architecture considerations, it preserved the model's quick response time. Consequently, we sacrificed a small degree of cryptographic depth for better performance but maintained an adequate security threshold, preventing unscrupulous data tampering or unauthorized access in a high-speed environment.

Instead of relying on a single form of authentication, MFA adds one or more additional layers that fall into different categories: Something you know like a password or a PIN Something you have like a phone, hardware token, or authentication app Something you are like a fingerprint, face scan, or other biometric For example To log in with MFA, a user might enter their password on a website (something they know) and then login to their phone with the face (something they are), so that they can approve a push notification on their phone (something they have). This drastically reduces the chances of an attacker getting in because even if they've stolen the password, they would still need access to the second factor. This matters because most breaches start with stolen or reused credentials. MFA doesn't make systems unbreakable, but it raises the bar enough that many attackers will move on to easier targets. Why interviewers ask this They're testing whether you understand real-world access control, not just theory. MFA is one of the simplest and most effective ways to reduce unauthorized access, and it's used everywhere from cloud platforms to VPNs to email. If you can explain how it works, why it matters, and how it fits into layered security, you're showing that you understand both the technical side and the practical impact."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are CyThIA, a helpful cybersecurity assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What's the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Encryption is how we keep data private, whether it's being stored or sent across a network. The key difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption comes down to how the keys work. Symmetric encryption uses the same key to both encrypt and decrypt data. That means both the sender and the receiver need to have access to the same secret key. It's fast and efficient, which makes it a good choice for encrypting large amounts of data such as entire hard drives or internal backups. The downside is key management in that if someone intercepts the key, they can decrypt everything Asymmetric encryption uses two keys: a public key and a private key. The public key encrypts the data, and only the private key can decrypt it. This is useful when two parties don't already share a key. It's slower than symmetric encryption but essential for things like HTTPS, email encryption (like PGP), and digital signatures. RSA and ECC are common examples Most modern systems use a mix of both. For example When you connect to a secure website, asymmetric encryption is used during the initial handshake to exchange a shared key, but after that, symmetric encryption is used for the rest of the session because it's faster.Why interviewers ask this Encryption is used constantly in real-world systems and you'll see both symmetric and asymmetric methods in play. If you can explain how they differ, when to use them, and what tradeoffs they involve, it shows you're ready to talk about security architecture in a meaningful way."}]}

They have found an evil advantage in cryptocurrency mining, which involves complex calculations to mine virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, and Litecoin. -Botnet Attacks: Botnet attacks often target large organizations and entities that obtain vast amounts of information.
